/**
 * Streamable HTTP `/mcp` core handler (SEC-8, SEC-1, SEC-2, PROD-1).
 *
 * A transport-pure handler: it takes a plain request shape and returns a plain
 * response shape, so the entire remote surface — Origin/CORS handling, Entra
 * auth, identity-bound sessions, per-tool scope gating, the hero-tool filter, and
 * JSON-RPC routing into the embedded engine — is unit-testable in-process with no
 * socket, no network, and no live Azure. The socket binding (`http.ts`) is a thin
 * adapter over this.
 *
 * Security ordering (each gate runs before the next does any work):
 *   1. Path + method shape.
 *   2. SEC-8 — Origin allow-list (strict; never `*`) and CORS (echoes the specific
 *      Origin, never wildcard-with-credentials).
 *   3. SEC-1 — Entra auth: no anonymous `/mcp`; audience-bound token.
 *   4. SEC-8 — identity-bound session id for every non-initialize request.
 *   5. PROD-1 — only the hero tools are listed/callable over HTTP.
 *   6. SEC-2 — per-tool scope authorization before dispatch.
 *
 * HTTPS is assumed to be terminated at the Container App ingress (the deployment
 * is HTTPS-only); this handler never serves plaintext and emits no protocol over
 * a non-TLS listener (see `http.ts`).

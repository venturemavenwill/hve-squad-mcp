/**
 * Squad memory-store seam (shared-state broker — DR-01 / DR-03).
 *
 * The Scenario B broker exposes the project's own `.copilot-tracking/squad/`
 * memory + history as scope-guarded, tenant-isolated MCP resources plus a
 * compare-and-swap (CAS) write-back tool. This module defines the persistence
 * ENTITY and the store SEAM the broker reads/writes through, deliberately
 * SEPARATE from the run-shaped {@link import("./run-state.js").RunState} (a memory
 * entry is not a run — DR-03 forbids overloading `RunState`).
 *
 * Two realizations land beside this seam, mirroring the run-state stores:
 *   * `file`  — {@link import("./backends/file-squad-memory.js").FileSquadMemoryStore}
 *     (single-replica, directory-backed; dev / single-instance).
 *   * `table` — {@link import("./backends/azure-table-squad-memory.js").AzureTableSquadMemoryStore}
 *     (Azure Table Storage with ETag CAS; multi-replica / production).
 *
 * Security posture (held by BOTH realizations):
 *   * Tenant isolation — the store key is ALWAYS prefixed with the authenticated
 *     `tenantId` (from the validated Entra token, never caller input). `project`
 *     is an explicit input (shape-checked at the protocol layer in later phases);
 *     the stores additionally reject unsafe segments so a traversal payload can
 *     never reach the filesystem / a foreign partition (SEC-4, defense in depth).
 *   * Encryption at rest — `content` is caller/model text, so both stores encrypt
 *     it with the injected {@link import("./field-cipher.js").FieldCipher} exactly
 *     as the run-state stores protect `request`/`context` (MEDIUM-3).
 *   * CAS — `write` takes an optional `expectedEtag`; a stale token loses the
 *     race (a 412 in the table store, an etag mismatch in the file store) so a
 *     concurrent writer never silently clobbers another's write.
 */

/**
 * Squad ARTIFACT store — the `.copilot-tracking` tree, persisted.
 *
 * Auto-memory persists three flat keys per project (`state`, `decisions`, and
 * `history/<toolId>-<runId>`). That is enough for continuity between two turns
 * and nothing like what a squad run under GitHub Copilot leaves behind: a roster
 * in `team.md`, a routing table, `state.json`, an append-only decision log, one
 * history file per agent, a consumption ledger, and a deliverable under each
 * role's own root (`research/<date>/`, `plans/`, `ppt/<date>/<slug>/`, `docs/`).
 * A Copilot Studio user who pushes a backlog out through a connector has to be
 * able to open the run that produced it afterwards, and flat keys cannot be
 * browsed.
 *
 * This seam adds TREE semantics — a prefix listing — on top of the stores that
 * already exist, rather than a sixth storage backend:
 *
 *   * {@link MemoryBackedArtifactStore} adapts ANY {@link SquadMemoryStore}, so
 *     the filesystem, Azure Table, SharePoint/Graph, the caller-selectable
 *     target allow-list, and the >32 KiB blob-overflow decorator ALL become
 *     artifact backends for free, keeping the tenant isolation, the CAS write,
 *     the traversal guards, and the at-rest encryption those stores already
 *     carry rather than re-implementing (and re-auditing) each one.
 *
 * Paths are stored with their `.copilot-tracking/` prefix intact. It is one
 * redundant segment against a real benefit: what the Graph and filesystem
 * backends write is then byte-for-byte the tree a developer already browses
 * locally, so "read the history" is the same operation in both places.

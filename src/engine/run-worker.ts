/**
 * Background run worker (WI-1b4-WORKER — the >240s escape hatch).
 *
 * The synchronous status poll can only drive a run within the Azure Container
 * Apps 240s HTTP ingress ceiling. A multi-agent pipeline can run longer, so in a
 * worker deployment the web tier's poll is READ-ONLY (`driveOnPoll: false`) and
 * THIS worker — an ACA Job on the SAME cross-replica run-state store — drives
 * approved runs off the request path.
 *
 * Safety is inherited, not re-implemented: the worker only ever picks up runs the
 * store reports as claimable (an APPROVED held run, or a `running` run whose lease
 * lapsed), and it drives each through {@link EmbeddedCoordinator.driveClaimable},
 * which CAS-claims the run first. So the gate is still non-bypassable (only an
 * out-of-band operator approval makes a held run claimable), tenant isolation is
 * unchanged, and two workers (or a worker racing a poll) cannot double-execute a
 * run — the loser of the CAS simply moves on.

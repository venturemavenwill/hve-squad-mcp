/**
 * Run-state seam (ARCH-1 — resumable-ready).
 *
 * The thin slice runs a single-stage hero tool (`squad_research`) whose state is
 * **ephemeral per request** — no resumability is needed. But the Gate B ADR
 * (docs/planning/adrs/0001) commits to a tenant-isolated *resumable* run-state
 * model for the long-running tools that land in Phase 1b / Phase 2. To avoid an
 * ephemeral-only lock-in (architect condition 1), the engine writes and reads
 * run state through THIS interface now, so a `DurableRunStateStore` can be
 * dropped in later (persisting to Storage/Key Vault and rehydrating after a
 * scale-to-zero cold start) without touching the embedded engine.
 *
 * No durable behavior is implemented here; only the seam plus the ephemeral
 * realization the thin slice uses.

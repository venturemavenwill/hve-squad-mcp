/**
 * Automatic squad-memory continuity for the EMBEDDED (remote) boundary.
 *
 * The shared-state broker shipped `squad_memory_read` / `_write` / `_sync` as
 * MANUAL tools: a host (or a Copilot Studio agent under generative orchestration)
 * had to decide to call them, and had to invent a `project` name. That is fine for
 * a scripted host and unusable for a business user — the agent forgets, or uses a
 * different project string each session, and continuity silently disappears.
 *
 * This module makes memory continuity DETERMINISTIC and server-side. It is not a
 * model behavior and cannot be forgotten, skipped, or prompt-injected away:
 *
 *   * BEFORE a dispatch, {@link AutoMemory.loadContext} reads the project's `state`
 *     and `decisions` entries and returns them for injection as **delimited DATA**
 *     (via {@link withMemoryContext}), never as authority. Memory content is
 *     model-produced text and is therefore exactly as untrusted as caller
 *     `context` — treating it as instructions would be a SEC-5 violation, so it
 *     is merged into `context`, which `composeEmbeddedPrompt` already neutralizes
 *     and delimits.
 *   * AFTER a completed dispatch, {@link AutoMemory.record} persists the artifact
 *     to `history/<toolId>-<runId>` and appends a one-line digest to `state` under
 *     compare-and-swap with a bounded retry.
 *
 * Tenant isolation is unchanged: `tenantId` always comes from the validated Entra
 * token at the call site and is the store's first argument. The `project`
 * partition is derived deterministically (see {@link AutoMemory.resolveProject}) —
 * NEVER from caller free text, which would let a caller land memory in an
 * arbitrary partition of its tenant and would make continuity non-reproducible.
 *
 * Failure posture: auto-memory is an ENHANCEMENT, never a dependency. Every store
 * interaction is wrapped so a memory outage degrades the run to "no continuity"
 * rather than failing an otherwise-successful advisory dispatch.

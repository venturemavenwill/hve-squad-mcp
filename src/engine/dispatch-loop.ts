/**
 * In-process multi-stage dispatch loop (embedded execution).
 *
 * The thin slice ran ONE server-side model dispatch per hero tool. This loop is
 * the next increment: it runs an ORDERED list of role personas as sequential
 * `ModelBackend.complete()` calls, threading each stage's output into the next as
 * DATA. For the spike the order is fixed (Squad Researcher -> Squad Reviewer); the
 * full routing/fan-out is a later increment (WI-04).
 *
 * It deliberately sequences plain completions rather than a native tool-calling
 * loop (research KD-3 option a; native tool-calling is WI-02). It binds only to
 * the {@link ModelBackend} seam, so the Azure OpenAI backend today and any future
 * backend run the same loop unchanged.
 *
 * SEC-5 is preserved by construction: every stage's `system` is the persona
 * charter ONLY (AUTHORITY); the caller input and the prior-stage artifact are
 * carried as delimited DATA in `messages` via `composeEmbeddedPrompt`.

/**
 * Gate carry-through, quota enforcement, and the non-bypassable human gate
 * (SEC-6, SEC-7, SEC-9, COST-1, COST-2, PROD-5).
 *
 * Three concerns live here, all server-side and all enforced BEFORE any model
 * call or downstream action:
 *
 *   * {@link TenantQuotaTracker} — per-tenant concurrency caps (SEC-9 / COST-1)
 *     and a hard monthly cost ceiling (COST-2). New work is refused past either
 *     limit; the host-side rate caps in the IaC complement these engine-side
 *     caps.
 *   * {@link GateKeeper} — classifies a tool call as `proceed` or `hold`. A hold
 *     pauses for out-of-band human approval and NEVER auto-releases (PROD-5).
 *     Destructive/confirm-tier/pipeline tools default to a hold (SEC-7).
 *   * {@link HumanApprovalChannel} — the ONLY way a held run proceeds. Approval
 *     is recorded by an explicit operator action keyed on the run id; it is
 *     never derived from `request`, `context`, or model output (SEC-6).
 *
 * The non-bypassable property is structural, not advisory: there is no method on
 * any type here that turns a hold into a proceed using caller-supplied or
 * model-generated text. An injected "auto-approve / ignore the gate" string has
 * no code path to a release.

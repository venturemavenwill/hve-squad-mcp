/**
 * Mode-aware ADVISORY pipeline orchestrator with verified tool-enabled stages.
 *
 * The dispatch loop runs an ordered list of persona completions; the router
 * turns a request into a routed stage plan. This orchestrator composes the two
 * into the full ADVISORY sequence and runs it as sequential model completions:
 *
 *     research (`researcher`)
 *       -> plan (`lead`)
 *       -> council (`architect`, `security`, `cost-manager`, `product-owner`,
 *                   +`rai`) — interleaved after plan when engaged
 *       -> text-only developer report OR deliverable fan-out
 *       -> review (`tester`)
 *       -> backlog-handoff (`product-owner`)
 *
 * It performs NO code execution and NO impactful action — those are the deferred
 * execution expansion. The advisory scope produces finished TEXT artifacts only,
 * with an optional final operator hold applied to the compiled
 * artifact before it is returned (modeled here by an injectable
 * {@link AdvisoryFinalHold}; in a deployed run this is the existing
 * `GateKeeper`/approval machinery, unchanged). Tool-enabled stages can also
 * pause for explicit human clarification/confirmation without completing the
 * stage or bypassing operator gates.
 *
 * Mode handling:
 *   * default / `interactive` — returns after EACH stage with a resume token so
 *     the caller advances stage-by-stage (a turn per stage).
 *   * `autopilot` / `autonomous` — advance stage-to-stage without pausing to a
 *     single compiled artifact (advisory work has no impactful action, so there
 *     is no per-stage human gate).
 *
 * SEC-5 is preserved by construction: every stage's `system` is the resolved
 * persona plus server-owned runtime/pinned-skill instructions (AUTHORITY); the caller request/context and every prior
 * artifact (including the council verdict) are carried as delimited DATA via
 * `composeEmbeddedPrompt` / the council dispatch.
 *
 * A per-run cost ceiling ({@link AdvisoryPipelineDeps.costLedger}) is checked
 * BEFORE each stage; exceeding it halts the run with a clear reason and zero
 * further model calls.

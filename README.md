# hve-squad MCP server

An outbound [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes the **hve-squad** as coarse, model-invocable tools (five per-role intent tools plus `squad_federate` for the opt-in federation of sub-squads) so MCP hosts can call the squad directly.

This is the outbound inverse of the squad's existing inbound MCP template (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`, which registers servers the squad *consumes*). This package ships the squad's *own* server, which other hosts consume.

## Status — what works today (read this first)

This server has **two execution modes**, at different maturity levels. Be precise about which one a claim refers to.

| Mode | Host | State | Behaves as the full APM package? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Delegated** (stdio) | VS Code GitHub Copilot (local) | Works | **Yes** — VS Code dispatches the real deployed cast. Needs the built package + `apm install` of the cast; install with `npx -y @hve-squad/mcp` or a local build. |
| **Embedded advisory hero tools** (`squad_research`, `squad_review`, `squad_plan`, `squad_architect`) | Copilot Studio / Cowork (remote HTTP) | See [runtime prerequisites](host/RUNBOOK.md#tool-enabled-research-and-artifact-gates) | Server-side Azure OpenAI dispatch under Entra auth, gates, tenant isolation and cost caps. With artifact storage enabled, bounded tools load pinned skills and persist outputs. A charter requiring unavailable tools is blocked, not treated as completed research. No code execution or deploy. |
| **Embedded async advisory pipeline** (`squad_run`, `squad_status`) | Copilot Studio / Cowork (remote HTTP) | Tool-enabled advisory stages; file or Azure Table persistence | Data-driven routing runs research → plan → council → review → backlog over the real cast. Research requires actual delegated evidence and verified artifacts before planning. This is not unrestricted VS Code/APM execution; unavailable capabilities and unresolved human decisions remain blockers. |
| **Deterministic render** (`squad_render_pptx`) | Copilot Studio (remote HTTP) | Opt-in (`SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_RENDER_PPTX=true`) | **First file-output tool.** Renders content YAML to a `.pptx` with in-image `python-pptx` and returns a short-lived Azure Blob **user-delegation SAS** download link (tenant-scoped path, SAS never logged, `Squad.Render` fail-closed scope, caller YAML is DATA). No model call. |
| **Zero-configuration OAuth** | Generic MCP HTTP clients | Opt-in (`SQUAD_MCP_SIMPLE_OAUTH_ENABLED=true`) | Server-owned OAuth 2.1 authority with RFC 9728/8414 discovery, RFC 7591 registration, loopback-only redirects, PKCE S256, operator-issued one-time browser codes, short-lived local JWTs, and rotating one-time refresh tokens. Existing Entra auth remains available. |
| **MISE Container v2 validation** | Azure Container Apps (remote HTTP) | Opt-in (`SQUAD_MCP_MISE_ENABLED=true`) | Entra tokens are validated by a pod-local Microsoft Identity Service Essentials sidecar before the existing exact audience, issuer, tenant, and per-tool scope checks. The endpoint is restricted to loopback, failures are fail-closed, and local simple-OAuth HS256 tokens never leave the application container. |

**The async pipeline (`squad_run`) routes the advisory squad** over the bundled cast, sequencing research → plan → (council) → review → backlog-handoff. Loading a persona alone does not supply its required tools. The bounded runtime executes native tool calls, applies server-owned artifact contracts, delegates read-only source-gathering lanes and verifies durable artifacts. Failed research stops the pipeline rather than becoming a successful deliverable. Specifics:

- **Off by default** (`SQUAD_MCP_REMOTE_PIPELINE_ENABLED=false`); the default remote surface is the advisory hero tools. Enabling the async pipeline requires a durable run-state backend.
- **Cast + routing.** Requests are routed to the real roster roles (researcher → lead → council members → tester) resolved from the SHA-pinned hve-squad v0.17 agent and instruction bundle; the council synthesizes a most-restrictive-wins Council Verdict (Go / Go-With-Conditions / Stop). It honors `mode` (interactive pauses per stage; `autopilot`/`autonomous` run to one compiled artifact). The active bundle and its provenance are documented in [host/cast-active](host/cast-active/README.md); the earlier `host/cast` working tree is retained but not used by the runtime.
- **Releasable by an operator.** `squad_run` holds at a non-bypassable Human Gate. An authenticated operator with `Squad.Operate` can submit an explicit human decision through the discoverable `squad_approve` MCP action or `POST /admin/approve`, then poll `squad_status` for the same run. Approval returns an auditable receipt (authenticated approver + timestamp), is tenant-scoped, and never starts replacement work. Ordinary `Squad.Run` permission cannot approve.
- **Same-run clarification.** An async advisory stage can pause with a server-generated question and optional caution notice. Cowork displays these verbatim, collects an explicit answer, and submits `squad_respond` with `Squad.Run`. An encrypted checkpoint resumes the same stage/run after the receipt is persisted; completed stages are not replayed. This is separate from operator approval and does not infer stakeholder signoff. See [human handoffs](host/RUNBOOK.md#same-run-questions-and-phase-confirmations) for limits and recovery.
- **GUID-bound project continuity.** Project-context schema 2 binds the immutable `projectId` to OneDrive/SharePoint `provider`, `driveId`, and `folderItemId`. Reusing a display name for a newly created folder does not reuse the old project's identity. Persist the server acknowledgment's resolved `project` partition for subsequent status/history calls; a safe upgrade keeps an existing project's legacy partition and artifacts rather than copying or resetting them. Schema 1 remains supported for existing clients. Renaming a folder preserves its GUID; copying/recreating one requires a fresh GUID. A deleted folder's stale binding is not automatically reassigned.
- **Two run-state backends** (`SQUAD_MCP_RUN_STATE_BACKEND`): `file` (single-replica, local dir) or `table` (Azure Table Storage, cross-replica ETag compare-and-swap). The `table` backend + a store-backed approval channel make release visible across replicas, so a **multi-replica / scale-to-zero** deployment is supported (WI-06). Per-stage artifacts, the Council Verdict, and caller `request`/`context` are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest when a key is configured.
- **Long runs (>240s)** are handled by an optional background **worker** (an ACA Job): with `SQUAD_MCP_WORKER_ENABLED=true` the status poll is read-only and the worker drives approved runs off the request path (WI-1b4-WORKER).

**Bottom line:** the local delegated package and the remote bounded runtime are different execution environments. Remote research can read supplied/project evidence, fetch public Microsoft Learn documentation, delegate bounded lanes and write verified Markdown/JSON artifacts. It cannot browse arbitrary sites, execute shell commands, read arbitrary SharePoint URLs, infer human signoff, or execute implementation/deployment. See the [runbook](host/RUNBOOK.md#tool-enabled-research-and-artifact-gates) for prerequisites, limits and recovery. A passing scripted test suite is not proof of a live authenticated Cowork run.

> Distribution: local **stdio** (delegated) targets VS Code; the remote Streamable HTTP + Entra path (embedded) serves Copilot Studio and the [Cowork plugin](cowork/README.md), deployed per [host/RUNBOOK.md](host/RUNBOOK.md). Cowork owns cloud-folder I/O, not server-stage orchestration.

## The tools

Each per-role tool maps 1:1 to a routing-table intent row in `squad-routing.instructions.md` (not to one of the ~200 agents); `squad_federate` maps to the Squad Federation Coordinator and drives the opt-in federation meta layer. The Squad Coordinator owns routing; these tools are shortcuts into it.

| Tool | Routing intent | Primary role | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `squad_research` | research, investigate, explore | Squad Researcher | auto |
| `squad_plan` | plan, break down, sequence | Squad Lead | confirm |
| `squad_review` | review, validate, check quality (+ council go/no-go) | Squad Reviewer (+ council) | auto / confirm |
| `squad_architect` | architecture, system design, components | System Architecture Reviewer | auto |
| `squad_run` | full classify-and-dispatch pipeline (catch-all) | Squad Coordinator | confirm + gates |
| `squad_federate` | federation meta layer: route across named sub-squads (catch-all) | Squad Federation Coordinator | confirm + gates |

Every tool's input mirrors the `/squad` prompt arguments: `request` (required), plus optional `profile`, `tier`, `owner`, `mode`, and `context`. All tools also accept an optional `squad` sub-squad name to target a federation sub-squad; `squad_federate` additionally accepts `init` to build a federation (or add a sub-squad to an existing one) and `promote` to adopt an existing single squad into a federation as its first sub-squad.

`init` and `promote` are always **confirmation-gated** here: they propose, and a human confirms. The squad also has an unattended bootstrap — Watch Mode auto-promotes or auto-expands a federation and seeds an event-named sub-squad (`issue-123`, `pr-456`) without asking — but that waiver is bounded by things only a repository event supplies: a `squad/*` label or `/squad` keyword opt-in, a write-collaborator check, and a name derived purely from event metadata. This server is not that trigger, so no MCP call can take that path, and a request claiming event provenance confers nothing.

Beside these six catalog tools the remote surface serves **synthetic** tools that are not squad routing intents (so they are not in `tools.catalog.yml` and do not participate in the generator drift check). Each has its own least-privilege scope and its own operator flag:

| Tool | Scope | Enabled by | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `squad_status` | `Squad.Run` | `SQUAD_MCP_REMOTE_PIPELINE_ENABLED` | Poll an async run by id. |
| `squad_render_pptx` | `Squad.Render` | `SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_RENDER_PPTX` | Render content YAML to a `.pptx` download link. |
| `squad_memory_read` / `_write` / `_sync` | `Squad.Memory` / `Squad.MemoryWrite` | `SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_MEMORY` | Read / CAS-write / batch-flush the project's own squad memory. |
| `squad_business_plan` | `Squad.Business` | `SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_BUSINESS_TOOLS` | A plain-language business plan for a non-technical stakeholder. |
| `squad_backlog` | `Squad.Backlog` | `SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_BUSINESS_TOOLS` | A **validated JSON** backlog contract for the native ADO/Jira connectors. |

### Federation (sub-squads)

`hve-squad@0.10.x` added an opt-in **federation**: one repository can host several named sub-squads (for example a `product` sub-squad for the business team and an `azure` sub-squad for the architects), each an ordinary squad rooted at `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`. The server surfaces this two ways:

- **`squad_federate`** maps to the **Squad Federation Coordinator**. It reads the federation registry (`federation.md`) and meta-routing (`meta-routing.md`), routes the request to the matching sub-squad(s) — or the explicit `squad=<name>` — and runs each scoped to its own root. Pass `init` to build a federation (propose → confirm → create) on a fresh project or to add a sub-squad to an existing federation (Expansion Mode: seed `members/<new>/` and register it in `federation.md` + `meta-routing.md`), or `promote` to adopt an existing single squad (a top-level `team.md`) into a federation as its first sub-squad, relocating its state intact (propose → confirm → migrate → seed → route).
- **The `squad` input** on the five coarse tools targets a single sub-squad directly (`squad_research` with `squad=azure` scopes to `members/azure/`).

Federation is additive: on a plain repository (no `federation.md`) the `squad` input is simply omitted and every tool behaves as before. Autonomy modes are forwarded to a single targeted sub-squad; with `mode=autopilot` and no `squad=` target, `squad_federate` runs a coordinated **federation-wide autopilot** meta-pipeline across sub-squads (ordered inner autopilot runs, federation-level gates attributed to the raising sub-squad, one aggregate `cost-ceiling`, and a single consolidated final-outcome validation).

**Federation over the remote boundary.** `squad_federate` is reachable from Copilot Studio when the operator enables the gated pipeline (`SQUAD_MCP_REMOTE_PIPELINE_ENABLED=true`). It is the same safety class as `squad_run` — a gated catch-all — so it inherits the same rules: it holds at the non-bypassable Human Gate, returns a run id, and is released by an authorized operator through `squad_approve` or `POST /admin/approve` before `squad_status` drives it to a finished federation decision. It requires its own **`Squad.Federate`** scope, deliberately separate from `Squad.Run`, and its `squad` / `init` / `promote` / `mode` inputs are persisted with the run so they survive the approve → poll cycle. Server-side it runs as a Federation Coordinator advisory stage: the routing decision, the per-sub-squad plan, dependencies, and federation-level gates as finished text. The scoping directive is composed only from validated inputs; the caller's free text stays delimited DATA.

### Requirements intake gate

`hve-squad@0.10.3` added a conditional **intake gate**: when a run is grounded in requirement or input artifacts (a PRD, BRD, spec, user story, design doc, transcript, or a referenced file), the coordinator validates those inputs for completeness, clarity, testability, consistency, and scope **before** it plans or builds, recording an `## Intake Readiness Verdict` (`Ready`, `Ready-With-Gaps`, `Not-Ready`) in `decisions.md`. On `Not-Ready` it runs a bounded auto-remediation loop (dispatch the analyst/product-owner to fill the blocking gaps, then re-validate; capped at two cycles) and escalates when a gap needs a human decision.

The server surfaces the gate in the **delegated (local VS Code)** path: the coordinator persona's gate context now instructs the host to run the intake gate ahead of the Implementation Gate whenever a request is requirements-driven. The gate maps to a new `intake-validator` role that reuses existing agents by input type (PRD Quality Reviewer by default; BRD Quality Reviewer; Squad Challenger), shipped with the `product` and `full` profiles. The gate is conditional and additive &mdash; with no input artifacts in scope it is a silent no-op.

The **embedded/advisory pipeline** (`squad_run`) now carries the gate too: `route()` prepends an intake stage for any profile that seeds `intake-validator` (`product`, `full`), and the pipeline records an `## Intake Readiness Verdict` before dispatching a downstream role. A `Not-Ready` verdict **halts the run** (`reason: "intake_not_ready"`) rather than letting the plan and deliverable stages build on inputs the validator just rejected; an unreadable verdict line degrades to `Ready-With-Gaps` rather than to `Ready`.

### Discovery gate

`hve-squad@0.15.0` added the intake gate's sibling, on the **inverse** trigger: the intake gate validates a requirement artifact when one exists, and the **discovery gate** fires when none does — a request that states a goal (`reduce onboarding drop-off`) rather than a settled task (`add a retry to the webhook client`). It brainstorms a **brief**, which the intake gate then validates, so the two chain rather than loop.

The gate is **offered, never automatic**. Validating a document is something an agent can do alone; ideation is not, because the value of a brainstorm is the human's ideas. So the coordinator asks once per topic, and the depth scales the session to the decision:

| `discovery=` | Dispatches | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quick` | `analyst` | the brief (the recommended default) |
| `standard` | `designer` (DT Coach), then `analyst` | framing, solution themes, brief |
| `deep` | `designer`, then `challenger` and `experimenter`, then `analyst` | framing, themes, objections, riskiest assumption, brief |
| `skip` | nothing | a `Depth: skip` verdict recording the declination |

The server surfaces it on the two catch-all entry points — a `discovery` input on **`squad_run`** and **`squad_federate`**, mirroring the `/squad` and `/squad-federation` prompt arguments — and states the contract in the delegated gate context ahead of the Intake Gate: only `analyst` writes a file (the brief, in the `analyst` Deliverable Root, carrying every option considered **with the reason each was discarded**), every dispatched role interviews the user one question at a time and stops rather than inventing an answer it could not get, and the Scribe records a `## Discovery Verdict` in `decisions.md` **including on a decline** — which is what stops the gate re-offering the same topic.

**The embedded path never runs it.** An unattended run has nobody to interview, so no offer is made, an explicit `discovery=` is ignored rather than honored (and logged as `discovery_ignored_unattended`), and the caller's payload becomes the intake gate's input instead. The unattended path is therefore never ungated — it is gated by validation rather than by ideation, the only one of the two it can honestly perform.

## Execution model — delegated (local VS Code)

The Step 0.1 delegated-drive spike validated this path (Question A = PASS): VS Code Copilot auto-invokes the tool and drives its own in-host dispatch loop. The spike was a disposable de-risking exercise; it is **not** shipped with the package (it is git-ignored — see `.gitignore`). In the delegated (local) mode the server runs **no model**; it returns:

- `systemPrompt` — the Squad Coordinator persona plus the squad instruction context relevant to the matched intent;
- `matchedRouting` — the routing row (role, tier, council, gates);
- `framedRequest` — the request framed as a dispatch instruction (do not answer inline; dispatch the matched role);
- `stateContext` — the squad state root and per-turn inputs.

The VS Code host ingests this and runs its own `runSubagent`/`task` loop to dispatch the cast — the same path the squad uses today, now reachable as a model-invocable tool instead of only the `/squad` slash command.

## Execution model — embedded (remote / Copilot Studio)

Over the remote Streamable HTTP `/mcp` boundary the server runs the squad stage **server-side** (embedded) and returns a finished, `squad-guided / embedded` artifact. This is the mode a Copilot Studio agent consumes. Deploy it with [host/RUNBOOK.md](host/RUNBOOK.md).

- **Hero tools** (`squad_research`, `squad_review`) — each runs a single server-side dispatch through the operator-configured Azure OpenAI endpoint, behind Entra audience-bound auth (SEC-1), per-tool scopes (SEC-2), strict Origin allow-list (SEC-8), identity-bound sessions, a per-tenant ephemeral workspace with guaranteed teardown (SEC-4), charter-injection containment (SEC-5), and per-tenant concurrency + monthly cost caps (SEC-9 / COST-2). **This path works and is deployable.**
- **Async pipeline** (`squad_run` → held run id; `squad_approve` → operator approval; `squad_status` → poll) — exposed only when the operator sets `SQUAD_MCP_REMOTE_PIPELINE_ENABLED=true` with a durable run-state backend (`file` local dir, or `table` = Azure Table Storage for multi-replica). Approval requires the distinct `Squad.Operate` permission; `POST /admin/approve` remains available to external operators. Cross-replica release uses the Table backend's ETag compare-and-swap + a store-backed approval record; long runs (>240s) are driven by an optional worker ACA Job (`SQUAD_MCP_WORKER_ENABLED=true`). See the [status section](#status--what-works-today-read-this-first) for the remaining limit (2-stage slice).

The embedded and delegated modes share the same router, tool schema, and persona source of truth behind one `CoordinatorEngine` seam; the security model is enforced in `src/transports/http-core.ts`, `src/auth/`, and `src/engine/` and proven by the conformance suites under `test/conformance/`.

### Optional zero-configuration OAuth for generic MCP clients

Entra remains the default remote identity provider. When tenant policy prevents
each desktop/CLI MCP client from registering an Entra application, an operator may
enable the server-owned OAuth authority instead:

- `/mcp` returns an RFC 9728 `WWW-Authenticate` challenge.
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` and
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` provide discovery.
- `/oauth/register` dynamically registers public clients without a secret.
- `/oauth/authorize` requires a short-lived, single-use code issued inside the
  running container and accepts only loopback HTTP redirects.
- `/oauth/token` requires PKCE S256, consumes authorization codes once, rotates
  refresh tokens on every use, and returns an access token valid for at most one
  hour.

The local issuer can grant ordinary tool scopes only. It never grants
`Squad.Operate`, so it cannot release a Human Gate through `squad_approve` or `/admin/approve`.
One-time code and grant records are indexed only by SHA-256 and their payloads are
encrypted before Azure Table Storage. The signing key is stored in Key Vault and
supports current-plus-previous key rotation. See
[host/RUNBOOK.md](host/RUNBOOK.md#optional-zero-configuration-oauth-no-entra-client-registration)
for deployment and code issuance.

## Squad memory — automatic, and portable beyond Azure

The shared-state broker exposes the project's own `.copilot-tracking/squad/` memory as tenant-isolated MCP resources plus compare-and-swap write tools (`SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_MEMORY=true`). Two additions make it usable by a business user in Copilot Studio.

**Automatic continuity (`SQUAD_MCP_MEMORY_AUTO_ENABLED=true`).** Memory used to work only if the agent remembered to call the memory tools with a project name it invented — unreliable under generative orchestration, and different every session. With auto-memory on, the server does it: before each embedded dispatch it reads the resolved project's `state` and `decisions` and injects them as **delimited DATA** (never authority, so memory cannot act as instructions); after a completed dispatch it writes the artifact to `history/<toolId>-<runId>` and appends a digest line to `state` under CAS with a bounded retry. The partition comes from a pinned federation sub-squad, else `SQUAD_MCP_MEMORY_DEFAULT_PROJECT` — never from caller free text, so continuity is reproducible and a caller cannot land memory in an arbitrary partition. Reads are capped so unbounded history cannot blow the context window, and a memory outage degrades the run to "no continuity" rather than failing it.

**Choose where memory lives.** `SQUAD_MCP_MEMORY_BACKEND` accepts:

| Backend | Persistence | CAS | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | local directory | in-file version+hash | single-replica / dev |
| `table` | Azure Table Storage | ETag | multi-replica / production |
| `graph` | **SharePoint document library or OneDrive** via Microsoft Graph | native `eTag` + `If-Match` | one readable `.md` per entry at `<rootPath>/<tenantId>/<project>/<path>.md` |

The `graph` backend keeps content **plaintext by default** — the point of a SharePoint target is that a human can open, review, and search the file — so encryption there is an explicit opt-in (`SQUAD_MCP_MEMORY_GRAPH_ENCRYPT=true`). The app identity needs an application permission on the target drive; [host/infra/graph-memory-permissions.bicep](host/infra/graph-memory-permissions.bicep) provisions it as least privilege — `Sites.Selected` (which grants no site access on its own) plus a write grant on the single designated site — so the server can reach only the library the operator chose. It is a separate, admin-run deployment so routine app deploys never need Graph admin rights.

A deployment can offer **several destinations at once** with `SQUAD_MCP_MEMORY_TARGETS` (a JSON array of named destinations) plus `SQUAD_MCP_MEMORY_DEFAULT_TARGET`. The memory tools then accept an optional `target` naming one of them. The operator owns every credential-bearing field — drive ids, storage accounts, directories — and the caller only ever sees an opaque name, the same allow-list pattern already used for model endpoints. An undeclared name is rejected before any I/O and never silently falls back to the default. Tenant isolation is unaffected: selecting a target changes *where* memory is written, never *whose* memory is reachable.

## Business-user surface (Copilot Studio and Teams)

`SQUAD_MCP_ENABLE_BUSINESS_TOOLS=true` adds two tools aimed at non-technical users:

- **`squad_business_plan`** — turns an idea or brief into a fixed-section, plain-language business plan (summary, problem and customer, proposed solution, value and success measures, scope, go-to-market, cost outline, risks, milestones, open questions). The fixed section order means successive runs are comparable and the agent can quote a section back to the user.
- **`squad_backlog`** — turns a request, business plan, or requirements document into a **validated JSON backlog contract**: epics → user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria → tasks, plus a flattened `workItems[]` carrying stable `ref` / `parentRef` ids.

`squad_backlog` is the piece that makes the Azure DevOps / Jira flow reliable. The native connector needs one call per work item with typed fields, so a prose handoff forces the orchestrator to parse English — the dominant failure mode (one giant work item, lost acceptance criteria, invented parents). With the JSON contract the agent iterates `workItems` in order, creates parents first, and links children by matching `parentRef` against the ids it recorded — no title matching, no guessing. The server validates and normalizes the model's JSON and fails cleanly if it cannot, so the agent never receives half-parsed output.

**The trust boundary is unchanged.** Neither tool writes to Azure DevOps or Jira. This server produces the plan; the certified native connector performs every write on the end user's own connection, under that connector's auth, DLP, and throttles. See [.copilot-tracking/changes/2026-07-24/scenario-a-copilot-studio-ado-jira-runbook.md](.copilot-tracking/changes/2026-07-24/scenario-a-copilot-studio-ado-jira-runbook.md) for the operator runbook, and the generated [agent-instructions.md](generated/copilot-studio-connector/README.md) for the paste-ready Copilot Studio instructions block.

## Build and run

Requirements: Node.js >= 20 (developed on Node 24).

```bash
cd squad-mcp
npm install
npm run build      # tsc -> dist/
npm test           # router + delegated + generator unit tests
npm run generate   # regenerate generated/mcp-tools.schema.json (drift-fails on mismatch)
```

To start the server manually on stdio (it speaks JSON-RPC; logs go to stderr):

```bash
node dist/src/server.js
```

## Register in VS Code (delegated / local mode)

1. Build once (`npm install && npm run build`).
2. Copy the `servers` entry from `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp-server.template.json` into your workspace `.vscode/mcp.json`.
3. Choose the command form:
   - published package: `npx -y @hve-squad/mcp`;
   - local build: `node` with an absolute path to `squad-mcp/dist/src/server.js`.
4. Reload VS Code. Ask Copilot to "research X with the squad"; the `squad_*` tools become available, and `squad_research` returns the delegated charter for Copilot to dispatch.

The package never writes your `.vscode/mcp.json` — the template is an example you copy.

## The manifest generator (drift check)

`generators/build-manifests.ts` reads the authored catalog plus the deployed squad sources — `squad-routing.instructions.md`, `squad-roster.instructions.md`, and the `*.agent.md` personas — all **read-only**, validates them against each other, and emits the runtime descriptor `generated/mcp-tools.schema.json`.

The build **fails (exit non-zero)** when a catalog tool maps to a routing intent that is not a real routing row, or to a role/council agent that is not an installed agent. Run it with `npm run generate`; wire it into CI to catch catalog/cast drift.

```

## Additive-only

Everything here is new. The generator reads the existing squad sources read-only and never duplicates agent logic; no existing agent, prompt, instruction, or skill is edited. The single source of truth for tool descriptions and routing remains the deployed `.agent.md` personas and the `squad-*` instructions.

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first. The short version: never edit `CHANGELOG.md` or the `version` in `package.json` — add a fragment with `npm run change` instead, and CI resolves the release from the fragments on `main`.

This repository is **public**. Never commit a tenant id, subscription id, resource endpoint, or secret. Report a vulnerability privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad-mcp/security/advisories/new), not a public issue.

# Squad Federation Conventions

These conventions define **federation**: running several named sub-squads under one hub so a single repository can host more than one squad — for example, a business team's `product` sub-squad and an architecture team's `azure` sub-squad, side by side. Federation is **opt-in and additive**. A repository that never opts in keeps exactly today's single-squad behavior.

Federation reuses every existing squad mechanism unchanged. Each sub-squad is an ordinary squad — same roster, routing, decisions, history, consumption, and single-writer Scribe discipline — only rooted at a named path instead of the top-level `.copilot-tracking/squad/`. The only new pieces are a **parameterized state root** and a thin **meta layer** (a registry, a meta-routing table, and the Squad Federation Coordinator) that classifies a request to one or more sub-squads and runs each scoped to its own root.

Routing across sub-squads is decided here and in `meta-routing.md`; routing *within* a sub-squad is unchanged (`squad-routing.instructions.md`). Roster and persistence rules are unchanged (`squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-state.instructions.md`).

## When a Pack Is the Answer Instead

Federation and packs both add capability a single profile does not carry, and the two are easy to confuse. The separating rule lives in *Pack or Federation* in `squad-roster.instructions.md`; the short form is that **one piece of work needing extra expertise is a profile plus a pack, and two streams of work with separate deliverables and owners is a federation.**

Two consequences matter before anyone builds a federation to solve a capability gap:

* **A federation does not reach a technology vertical any faster than a plain squad does.** A sub-squad is seeded from a profile, so a vertical arrives on it by applying the pack, exactly as on any other roster. Building a sub-squad named after a vertical still requires the pack, and adds a duplicated methodology spine, a second state tree, and a second consumption ledger for no additional reach.
* **Splitting one piece of work across two sub-squads splits its record.** Each sub-squad keeps its own `decisions.md`, `history/`, and deliverable roots rebased under `members/<name>/`, so two halves of one decision are taken in two councils that never met. A pack keeps those roles in one turn, one council, one plan, and one review.

Federate when the sub-squads own genuinely separate outcomes — a business team's discovery work beside an architecture team's infrastructure build, or Watch Mode giving each triggering event its own sub-squad and its own pull request. Do not federate to obtain a role.

## Squad Root (`squadRoot`)

A squad's state lives under a **squad root**. The root is parameterized:

* The default squad root is `.copilot-tracking/squad/`. Every state path in `squad-state.instructions.md` (`team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `history/<agent>.md`, `state.json`, `consumption.md`, and the rest) is `<squadRoot>/...`, and the default keeps today's literal paths.
* In a federation, each sub-squad roots at `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`, where `<name>` is the sub-squad's registered name (lower-kebab-case). That directory holds the sub-squad's full standard state tree.
* The Squad Coordinator and the Squad Scribe accept an optional `squadRoot`; when omitted, the default preserves single-squad behavior. The Squad Federation Coordinator sets `squadRoot=.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/` when it drives a sub-squad.

Because every squad instruction file's `applyTo` is `**/.copilot-tracking/squad/**`, all conventions auto-apply at any depth, so a sub-squad tree under `members/<name>/` inherits the roster, routing, and state rules without any `applyTo` change.

## Federation State Layout

A federation adds a small meta layer at the federation root (`.copilot-tracking/squad/`) and nests each sub-squad under `members/<name>/`:

| Path                                   | Purpose                                                                     | Write Semantics    |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `federation.md`                        | Registry of sub-squads (name, profile, kind, location, owner, description)   | Replace via scribe |
| `meta-routing.md`                      | Request pattern / domain → sub-squad routing table                          | Replace via scribe |
| `decisions.md`                         | Federation-level cross-squad routing decisions and rationale                | Append-only        |
| `history/<sub-squad>.md`               | Per-sub-squad federation dispatch history (which sub-squad ran, for what)   | Append-only        |
| `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md`        | Federation autopilot meta-run summary linking each sub-squad's inner run     | Append-only        |
| `state.json`                           | Federation status: active sub-squads, mode, current-run cost, open escalations, federation-wide `notify` default | Replace via scribe |
| `members/<name>/`                      | A full ordinary squad state tree (the sub-squad's `squadRoot`)              | Per squad-state    |

Each `members/<name>/` directory is an unmodified squad: `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `notifications.md`, `history/<agent>.md`, `state.json`, `consumption.md`, and `consumption-rates.md`, all governed by `squad-state.instructions.md` rooted at `members/<name>/`.

**A healthy federation root holds four files plus a `history/` directory.** `federation.md`, `meta-routing.md`, `decisions.md`, and `state.json` are seeded when the federation is built, promoted, or expanded; `history/<sub-squad>.md` is created for each registered sub-squad and appended on every turn routed to it. `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md` appears only when a federation-level autopilot meta-run has been executed, so its absence is expected rather than a gap. There is deliberately no `team.md`, `routing.md`, `notifications.md`, `consumption.md`, or `consumption-rates.md` at the federation root — those are per-sub-squad files and their presence at the top level is the mixed-state condition described under *Detection Precedence*. A federation root missing `history/` after routed turns is the one shape to treat as a defect: it means the federation-level hand-off appended the decision and dropped the per-sub-squad entry.

The federation `state.json` also carries the `notify` object captured **once** at build time. Every sub-squad inherits it into its own `state.json`, and a sub-squad's Init never re-asks the approval-channel question; a sub-squad may hold its own overriding `notify` object, which wins over the federation default at send time. See *Capture in a Federation* in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`.

The federation root's `decisions.md` and `history/<sub-squad>.md` are **append-only**; `federation.md`, `meta-routing.md`, and the federation `state.json` use **replace** semantics — mirroring the per-squad rules one level up. The federation `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md` is **append-only by topic-id** and is written only for a federation-level autopilot meta-run; see `.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md`. The federation `state.json` carries additive `mode` and `currentRun` fields for that meta-run (the autonomy mode in effect and the cost aggregated across every sub-squad inner run); both are backward-compatible, so a federation that never runs autopilot omits or zeroes them and existing state stays valid.

## Detection Precedence

The Squad Coordinator resolves what kind of squad a project has at the start of a turn, checking `.copilot-tracking/squad/` in this order:

1. **`federation.md` present** → **federation mode**. The Squad Federation Coordinator owns the turn: it reads the registry and meta-routing, selects the target sub-squad(s), and runs each scoped to `members/<name>/`. When the Squad Coordinator itself is invoked with an explicit `squadRoot`, it operates directly against that sub-squad root.
2. **No `federation.md`, but `team.md` present** → **plain single-squad mode**. Behavior is exactly today's: the Squad Coordinator runs the six-step protocol against `.copilot-tracking/squad/`.
3. **Neither present** → **Init Mode**. The user is offered a plain squad (the default) or a federation of named sub-squads.

`federation.md` at the top level versus `team.md` at the top level is the single discriminator between a federation and a plain squad. The two are mutually exclusive at the federation root: a federation keeps `team.md` only inside each `members/<name>/`, never at the top. When both are present — a state a manual edit can produce — precedence still makes the project a federation, and the stray top-level `team.md` is reported for a human to reconcile rather than silently promoted.

An **event-triggered Watch Mode run** resolves the same precedence but never stops at case 2 or 3: it bootstraps whatever is missing (Init, automatic Promotion, or automatic Expansion) so the run always executes inside a sub-squad dedicated to its triggering event. See `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`.

## Promotion: Single Squad → Federation

An existing single-squad project already has a top-level `team.md`, so the Init-Mode single-squad-or-federation offer (which fires only when neither `team.md` nor `federation.md` exists) never reaches it, and detection precedence keeps it a plain squad. **Promotion** is the additive path that adopts that existing squad into a federation as its first sub-squad without losing any state. It is opt-in and confirmation-gated: a consumer who never promotes is completely unaffected.

Promotion is a **relocation, not a rebuild**. It moves the existing top-level squad tree under a named sub-squad root and seeds the thin meta layer; it never re-creates the roster or rewrites the append-only logs.

### Trigger

The Squad Federation Coordinator enters Promotion Mode when **all** of these hold: a top-level `team.md` is present, no top-level `federation.md` is present, and the user asks to move to a federation (or invokes `/squad-federation promote`). The single Squad Coordinator, on detecting a top-level `team.md` and a user request to federate, offers the handoff to `/squad-federation promote` rather than promoting anything itself. Nothing is moved or written before the user confirms.

### Steps (Scribe-performed)

1. **Choose the sub-squad name.** Default to a name derived from the existing squad's seeded profile (for example, `default`, `azure`, `product`), normalized to lower-kebab-case and validated per *Sub-Squad Naming and Uniqueness*. The user may override. The name must not collide with an existing `members/<name>/` directory.
2. **Relocate the existing tree.** Move the full top-level squad state tree — `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `notifications.md`, `state.json`, `consumption.md`, `consumption-rates.md`, and `history/<agent>.md` — from `.copilot-tracking/squad/` into `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`, preserving contents byte-for-byte apart from the single roster column step 5 rebases. Append-only files (`decisions.md`, `history/<agent>.md`, per-dispatch consumption blocks) are moved intact, never edited or truncated. Because the squad root is parameterized (`<squadRoot>/...`), the moved files keep working unchanged once rooted at `members/<name>/`.
3. **Enumerate the pre-promotion deliverables from disk, never from the table.** The squad's artifacts were written to the single-squad deliverable roots, and *Deliverable Roots* in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md` rebases those roots under `members/<name>/` the moment the federation exists — so an artifact left at its old path falls outside the root its own roster now points at. The lookup table in *Deliverable Roots* names the roots the cast writes today; it does not name every directory a session produced. Build the candidate list by listing `.copilot-tracking/` and taking every directory except `squad/` itself, then confirm the list with the user before anything moves. Session directories such as `brd-sessions/`, `prd-sessions/`, `details/`, `plans/`, `research/`, and `changes/` are the common case, and a table-only list silently leaves them behind. When a candidate directory predates the squad or was produced by a plain workflow rather than by this squad, say so in the proposal and let the user keep it in place; ambiguity is resolved by asking, never by skipping silently.
4. **Relocate the confirmed deliverables.** Move each confirmed directory into `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`, preserving its internal structure and every file's contents byte-for-byte. `docs/` and `outputs/` stay at the repository root, because the same rebasing rule already exempts them as repository-wide outputs.
5. **Rebase the relocated roster's deliverable roots.** The moved `team.md` still points every role at the repository-root tracking paths the artifacts just left, so prefix each `Deliverable Root` cell that begins with `.copilot-tracking/` with `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`, leaving `docs/` and `outputs/` unchanged. Rebase whatever the cell holds, including a path the consumer edited by hand, so a customized root survives the promotion pointing at its own relocated directory. This column is the one field a promotion rewrites, and it is deliberate: `team.md` has replace semantics, and the byte-for-byte guarantee protects the append-only logs rather than freezing a roster whose paths the promotion has just invalidated. Nothing else in the roster changes — no role is re-cast, renamed, added, or dropped.
6. **Seed the meta layer** at the federation root `.copilot-tracking/squad/`: `federation.md` with one row for the promoted sub-squad (profile inferred from the moved `team.md`, `kind=in-repo`, `location=members/<name>/`); `meta-routing.md` whose patterns all route to that sole sub-squad initially (derived from its profile and description); a federation `decisions.md` whose first entry records the promotion and the source→destination move; `history/<name>.md`; and a federation `state.json`.
7. **Carry the consumption ledger across the boundary.** The relocated `consumption.md` and `consumption-rates.md` describe a run that continues after the promotion, so the promotion itself is a recorded turn rather than a gap in the ledger: the Scribe writes the promotion's orchestration consumption into the relocated sub-squad's `members/<name>/history/scribe.md` and rewrites `members/<name>/consumption.md` from the relocated history, then seeds the federation `state.json` `currentRun` cost totals from that ledger's total row. A federation whose first turn reports zero cost while the sub-squad it just adopted carries a populated ledger is reporting the promotion as free, which it was not.

The move (step 2) removes the top-level `team.md`, so detection precedence flips from "top-level `team.md`" (plain squad) to "top-level `federation.md`" (federation) the moment promotion completes. From the next turn, `/squad-federation` owns turns and `/squad` detects the federation and defers.

### Copy, Verify, Then Delete

Every move in steps 2 and 4 is a **copy → verify → delete-source** sequence, in that order, per file. Write the destination first, read it back and confirm it matches the source, and only then remove the source. Nothing at the source is removed, cleared, or truncated before its destination copy exists and has been verified.

Deleting first is the one failure mode this contract exists to prevent: a relocation that clears the source and then cannot find the files to move has destroyed append-only decision and history logs that no later step can reconstruct. When a destination write fails, stop and escalate with the source still intact; a partially relocated tree with an intact source is recoverable, and a deleted source is not.

**Every destination path is written from the project root, including the parent directories the move creates**, and the promotion creates nothing outside `.copilot-tracking/squad/`. `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/plans/` is the whole path, not a segment to append to wherever the last step was working. The observed failure created its destinations from inside `.copilot-tracking/` and left `.copilot-tracking/.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/` behind — empty, so no file was lost and no step reported a failure, while the tree gained a second tracking directory that every later path resolution has to step around. Before the promotion is confirmed, list `.copilot-tracking/` and remove anything the move created by accident, along with any directory the move emptied.

### Guards

* **Idempotency.** When a top-level `federation.md` already exists, the project is already a federation — the coordinator does not promote; it routes the request (or runs Federation Init to add a sub-squad) instead.
* **No overwrite.** Promotion never moves the existing tree into a `members/<name>/` directory that already exists; on a name collision the coordinator stops and asks the user to choose a different name.
* **No deliverable overwrite.** A deliverable directory is never merged into an existing one of the same name under `members/<name>/`; on a collision the promotion stops with both copies intact and asks the user how to reconcile, rather than overwriting an artifact.
* **Additional sub-squads (optional).** In the same promotion turn the user may add further sub-squads by reusing Federation Init's propose → confirm → create for each new one; the minimum promotion wraps the existing squad as exactly one sub-squad.

### Automatic Promotion (Watch Mode)

An event-triggered **Watch Mode** run has no human in the loop at trigger time, yet it must execute inside an event-scoped sub-squad. When such a run finds a plain single squad — a top-level `team.md` and no `federation.md` — it performs the same promotion **auto-approved**, then adds the event's own sub-squad through *Automatic Expansion* below. The full trigger contract is `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`.

Everything about the promotion is otherwise identical: the same Scribe-performed relocation, the same copy → verify → delete-source ordering, the same byte-for-byte preservation of the append-only logs, the same meta-layer seed, the same collision refusal, the same consumption carry-over. Only the confirmation step differs, and that exception is deliberately bounded — the operation writes only under `.copilot-tracking/`, it runs only after the Watch Mode opt-in gate and trigger authorization have already passed, it is a relocation rather than a rebuild, and it waives no Human Gate inside the run.

* **Unattended deliverable enumeration.** There is no user to confirm the candidate list, so the run moves every `.copilot-tracking/` directory except `squad/` and records the moved list in the promotion decision entry for a human to review. A collision still stops the run rather than resolving itself.
* **Name derivation.** The promoted sub-squad takes the name of the profile recorded in the existing `team.md` (for example `azure`, `product`), normalized and validated per *Sub-Squad Naming and Uniqueness*, falling back to `default` when the profile cannot be read. The name is never derived from the triggering event, because the squad predates it.
* **Concurrent promotion is a compare-and-swap.** Two events may be in flight and both observe a plain single squad. The Scribe's existing refusal when a `federation.md` already exists is the swap check: the loser re-detects the repository state once and continues as an expansion instead. Only a second consecutive failure escalates.
* **Escalation, not overwrite.** A collision with an existing `members/<name>/` directory stops the run and escalates on the source thread, exactly as the interactive guard does. Watch Mode never proceeds without its sub-squad.

## Expansion: Add a Sub-Squad to an Existing Federation

Once a federation exists, a team can grow it by **adding a new sub-squad** — for example, adding a `security` sub-squad alongside an existing `product` and `azure`. Expansion is the first-class operation for this; it is additive and confirmation-gated, and it never touches an existing sub-squad. Expansion is what the Federation Init entry point does when a federation is **already present**: Init *builds* a federation on a fresh project (no `federation.md`) and *expands* one when a `federation.md` is already there.

### Trigger

The Squad Federation Coordinator runs Expansion when a top-level `federation.md` is present and the user asks to add a sub-squad (or passes `init`, which on an existing federation means expand, not rebuild). Nothing is written before the user confirms.

### Steps

1. **Propose the new sub-squad(s).** Each is a unique lower-kebab-case name, a profile (or a custom roster), an optional owner, and a one-line description, proposed from the repo and request exactly as Init proposes a sub-squad. Validate each name per *Sub-Squad Naming and Uniqueness*, comparing it against the existing `federation.md` rows and the `members/` directories.
2. **Seed the new sub-squad's tree** under `members/<new>/` via the standard Squad Coordinator Init scoped to that root (its `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `notifications.md`, `state.json`, `consumption.md`, `consumption-rates.md`, and `history/`), exactly as Federation Init Phase 2 seeds each sub-squad.
3. **Register it (Scribe-performed, preserve-on-replace).** `federation.md` and `meta-routing.md` use replace semantics, so the Scribe **read-merge-writes** them: it appends the new sub-squad's registry row to `federation.md` and its pattern → sub-squad route to `meta-routing.md`, preserving every existing row and route. It appends a federation-level `decisions.md` entry recording the addition and creates `history/<new>.md`. Existing sub-squad rows, routes, decisions, and history are never edited or removed.

### Guards

* **No overwrite.** Expansion never seeds into a `members/<new>/` directory that already exists, and never registers a name already in `federation.md`; on a collision the coordinator stops and asks the user to choose a different name.
* **Additive only.** Expansion adds a sub-squad; it never edits, renames, or removes an existing one. Renaming or removing a sub-squad is a separate, explicit Scribe-performed operation.
* **Requires a federation.** When no top-level `federation.md` exists, this is not an expansion: build a federation (Init) or adopt an existing single squad (Promotion) instead.

### Automatic Expansion (Watch Mode)

A **Watch Mode** run adds its own event-scoped sub-squad through this same expansion path, **auto-approved** rather than confirmation-gated, for the same bounded reasons given under *Automatic Promotion (Watch Mode)*. The registration is unchanged: preserve-on-replace read-merge-write of `federation.md` and `meta-routing.md`, a federation-level `decisions.md` entry, and a new `history/<name>.md`.

* **Event-derived name.** The new sub-squad's name comes from the event's structural identity (`issue-<N>`, `pr-<N>`, `sweep-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, `push-<branch-slug>-<sha7>`, `dispatch-<runId>`), never from payload prose. The naming table and normalization rules live in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`.
* **Reuse before create.** When the derived name already exists as a watch-owned sub-squad whose recorded trigger provenance matches this event, the run reuses it and no expansion occurs. A watch-owned name with different provenance is disambiguated by appending the workflow run id once.
* **Never into a human-owned sub-squad.** When the derived name matches a sub-squad that is not watch-owned, the run escalates and stops. A `members/<name>/` directory with **no registry row** is resolved by evidence rather than refused outright: when its `state.json` `trigger.ref` and `trigger.eventId` match the current event it is this run's own prior attempt, so the row is re-registered and the run resumes; otherwise it is treated as human-owned and the run escalates and stops. See *Reuse, Collisions, and Concurrency* in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`. The no-overwrite guard remains absolute in the unattended path: nothing that cannot prove it belongs to this event is ever written into.

## Cross-Sub-Squad Handoff

Sub-squad isolation is deliberate: each sub-squad reads and writes inside its own root so parallel runs never race and each keeps its own auditable record. That same isolation means a sub-squad **cannot discover another's work on its own**. A run scoped to `members/azure/` resolves every deliverable root under `members/azure/`, so a `product` sub-squad's PRD sitting at `members/product/plans/` is invisible to it. Nothing in a sub-squad's inner run reads federation-level state, so the federation `decisions.md` is not a discovery mechanism either — it records that a sub-squad ran, for the federation's audit trail, not a path index the next sub-squad consults.

The Squad Federation Coordinator is the only component that sees both roots, so **it resolves the producer's artifacts and hands them to the consumer as explicit read-only input paths.** A consumer that was handed no paths was handed no dependency.

* **The interface is the producer's artifacts, not its state.** A handoff passes files under `members/<producer>/` — the PRD, the research, the plan. The producer's `decisions.md` and `history/` say *which* artifact is current and why, and are worth passing alongside for that reason, but they are never the substitute for the artifact itself.
* **Resolve paths by reading, then verify by listing.** Read the producer's `team.md` `Deliverable Root` cells to know where its roles write, then list those directories and confirm each file exists before passing it. A handoff path that this turn did not enumerate is a guess, and a consumer sent to a path that does not exist fails in the middle of its run rather than at the boundary.
* **Producer before consumer, and the pair is not parallel-eligible.** A dependency makes the two runs ordered by definition. When meta-routing fans a request out to both, run the producer's turn to completion — including its artifact gate — before dispatching the consumer, and say so when proposing the fan-out.
* **Read-only across the boundary, always.** The consumer reads the producer's artifacts and writes its own output under its own root. A sub-squad never writes into another's `members/<name>/` tree, never edits a producer's artifact to suit itself, and never appends to a producer's logs. When the consumer's work implies a change to the producer's artifact, that is a request routed back to the producer, not an edit made across the boundary.
* **Record the handoff.** Append a federation-level `decisions.md` entry naming the producer, the consumer, and the artifacts passed. This is what makes a two-sub-squad outcome reconstructable later: without it, the consumer's plan cites requirements whose origin is nowhere in the record.
* **A missing producer artifact escalates; it never falls back to re-derivation.** When the producer has not produced the artifact yet, or its deliverable root is empty, stop and run the recovery below rather than dispatching the consumer to work it out. A consumer that re-derives the requirements produces a plausible, complete-looking deliverable built on requirements the product sub-squad never agreed \u2014 the two halves then diverge silently, which is worse than a stalled run because nothing in the output reveals it.

### Recovery: What Happens When the Input Is Missing

Stopping is the safety property, not the outcome. The coordinator already knows which sub-squad owns the missing artifact, so the default recovery is to **produce it and then continue the same turn** \u2014 the user should not have to re-issue the request. This mirrors the bounded auto-remediation loop in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-intake-gate.instructions.md`, and reuses its vocabulary rather than inventing a second one.

Resolve in this order, taking the first case that applies:

1. **The producer sub-squad is registered and simply has not run.** Run it first, then resume the consumer in the same turn once its artifact verifies on disk. Ordering was already the declared contract for a dependency, so this is enforcing the order rather than making a new decision. Interactive turns state what will run and wait for a go-ahead; an autopilot or Watch Mode run does it without asking, because dependency-first ordering was settled at its plan meta-stage.
2. **The artifact exists but is partial or stale.** Re-dispatch only the producing **stage** inside the producer sub-squad, not the whole sub-squad, and say which artifact fell short and how. Re-running a completed sub-squad to fix one stage discards work that was fine.
3. **No sub-squad owns the artifact.** This is a structural gap, not a run failure: the federation has no producer for what the consumer needs. Offer Federation Expansion to add the owning sub-squad, or accept a path the user supplies to an artifact that already exists elsewhere in the repository. Do not route the work to the consumer because it happens to be the sub-squad in front of you.
4. **The user overrides.** The user may always name an input path directly, or accept proceeding **with the gap recorded as an explicit assumption** — the `Ready-With-Gaps` shape from the intake gate. Recording is what separates this from re-derivation: the consumer's output then carries a visible statement of what it assumed and who chose to proceed, instead of presenting an invented requirement as an agreed one.

**Bound the loop.** One producer run per handoff per turn. A second consecutive miss on the same artifact escalates to the user rather than looping again, exactly as the intake gate escalates on divergence. Each producer run and each re-dispatch is a normal Scribe-recorded stage with its own history entry and consumption block, so the recovery is auditable rather than invisible.

The same contract governs a **federation autopilot** meta-run, where the ordering is resolved once in the plan meta-stage; see `.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md`.

## Registry Schema (`federation.md`)

The registry is the durable list of sub-squads the Federation Coordinator can route to. It begins with YAML frontmatter and a single H1, then a `## Sub-Squads` table:

| Column      | Meaning                                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sub-squad   | Unique name, lower-kebab-case (for example, `product`, `azure`); also the `members/<name>/` directory |
| Profile     | The profile the sub-squad was seeded from (`default`, `full`, `security`, `design`, `accessibility`, `architecture`, `azure`, `modernization`, `compliance`, `operations`, `product`) or `custom`, followed by any applied packs in `+pack` form (for example, `azure +power-platform`) |
| Kind        | `in-repo` (state under `members/<name>/`) — `repo` is reserved for the deferred multi-repo federation |
| Location    | `members/<name>/` for an `in-repo` sub-squad                                                          |
| Owner       | Optional human or team label (for example, `business-team`, `architects`)                            |
| Description | One-line purpose the meta-routing table uses to choose this sub-squad                                 |

`Kind=repo` and external `Location` values are defined by the deferred multi-repo plan and are not seeded by the in-repo flow.

### Registry Example

```markdown
## Sub-Squads

| Sub-squad | Profile | Kind    | Location          | Owner         | Description                                              |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| product   | product | in-repo | members/product/  | business-team | Requirements, roadmap, and stakeholder deliverables     |
| azure     | azure   | in-repo | members/azure/    | architects    | Azure build: Bicep, landing-zone, cost, and deployment  |
```

### Watch-Owned Sub-Squads

Sub-squads created by the unattended Watch Mode bootstrap are marked with the registry's existing optional columns, so no schema change is needed and every existing registry stays valid:

* `Owner` is `watch-mode`. This marker is the discriminator that lets the unattended path decide whether a name collision is a safe reuse or a refusal.
* `Description` records the source ref and the terminal deliverable, for example `Watch Mode run for owner/repo#123 (issue) -> PR #456`.
* The `meta-routing.md` route for a watch-owned sub-squad is **narrow and ref-keyed**: its `Pattern / Domain` is the exact event ref token (for example `watch: owner/repo#123`) and `Parallel-Eligible` is `no`. A broad keyword pattern would hijack interactive routing, so watch-owned sub-squads are never selected by keyword matching — Watch Mode targets them by name.

```markdown
| Sub-squad | Profile | Kind    | Location           | Owner      | Description                                          |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| issue-123 | default | in-repo | members/issue-123/ | watch-mode | Watch Mode run for owner/repo#123 (issue) -> PR #456 |
```

Watch-owned sub-squads are **retained**: they are the audit trail of what continuous AI did, so nothing prunes them automatically. Archiving or removing one is a separate, explicit, human-initiated Scribe operation, exactly as renaming or removing any sub-squad is.

### Sub-Squad Naming and Uniqueness

Every sub-squad has a **required, unique name** because the name is simultaneously the registry key, the `members/<name>/` state directory, and the `squad=<name>` selector the user types to target it. A collision would make two sub-squads share one folder and one selector, so names are validated before any folder is created.

* **Required.** No sub-squad may be nameless — including a custom sub-squad the user builds from a role menu. When the user proposes a custom sub-squad without naming it, the coordinator asks for a name before creating it.
* **Format.** Lower-kebab-case, matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` (letters, digits, and internal hyphens; no spaces, slashes, dots, uppercase, or leading hyphen) so the name is a safe directory segment and an unambiguous selector. The coordinator suggests a normalized form when the user offers a name that does not fit (for example, `Data Platform` → `data-platform`).
* **Unique within the federation.** No two sub-squads may share a name, compared case-insensitively after normalization. Before creating sub-squads, the coordinator checks the proposed set against itself and against any name already in `federation.md`; on a duplicate it stops and asks the user to rename one before proceeding — it never auto-suffixes silently or reuses an existing `members/<name>/` directory.
* **Stable.** The name is the durable handle used across turns. Renaming a sub-squad later means renaming its `members/<name>/` directory and its `federation.md` row together (a Scribe-performed change), so the coordinator treats a rename as an explicit operation, not a routine edit.

These rules are the sub-squad-level analogue of the per-member `Member Name` uniqueness in `squad-roster.instructions.md`: there, names disambiguate two rows of the same role; here, names disambiguate two sub-squads so each maps to exactly one folder and one selector.

## Meta-Routing Schema (`meta-routing.md`)

Meta-routing decides *which sub-squad* handles a request, the layer above the per-squad routing that decides *which role* acts. It begins with YAML frontmatter and a single H1, then a routing table:

| Column            | Meaning                                                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pattern / Domain  | The request trigger the Federation Coordinator matches (keywords, domain, or phrasing)       |
| Sub-squad         | The registered sub-squad the pattern routes to (must exist in `federation.md`)              |
| Parallel-Eligible | `yes` when the sub-squad can run concurrently with other sub-squads for one request; else `no` |

### Meta-Routing Example

```markdown
| Pattern / Domain                                                | Sub-squad | Parallel-Eligible |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| requirements, PRD, BRD, roadmap, backlog, stakeholder, discovery | product   | yes               |
| Azure, Bicep, landing zone, deploy, IaC, cost, infrastructure    | azure     | yes               |
```

### Meta-Routing Rules

* Match the most specific pattern first; when several match, prefer the sub-squad that most directly owns the requested outcome.
* An explicit `squad=<name>` target from the user overrides meta-routing for the turn.
* Dispatch parallel-eligible sub-squads concurrently; run non-parallel sub-squads sequentially. Each sub-squad's own routing then governs role dispatch inside it.
* Escalate to the user — rather than guessing — when no pattern matches with reasonable confidence, when a matched sub-squad is not in the registry, or when two patterns conflict with no clearly more specific match. State the ambiguity, list the candidate sub-squads, and ask the user to choose.

## Two-Level State and the Single Writer

Federation keeps the single-writer rule at both levels: only the Squad Scribe writes squad state, and it writes at whichever root the coordinator hands it.

* **Sub-squad level.** When the Federation Coordinator drives a sub-squad, the Scribe writes that sub-squad's `decisions.md`, `history/<agent>.md`, `consumption.md`, and the rest under `members/<name>/`, exactly as for a plain squad. Proof-of-dispatch is unchanged: a sub-squad stage is proven by a `members/<name>/history/<agent>.md` entry plus its consumption block. The pre-work gates are sub-squad state like everything else: a `## Discovery Verdict` and a `## Intake Readiness Verdict` land in `members/<name>/decisions.md`, and a discovery brief lands in `members/<name>/plans/`, never at the federation root.
* **Federation level.** The Federation Coordinator hands the Scribe a federation-level decision and a per-sub-squad history entry recording which sub-squad was routed to and why. These land at the federation root's `decisions.md` and `history/<sub-squad>.md` and reference the sub-squad's own decision entries so the two levels stay linked.

Neither the Federation Coordinator nor the Squad Coordinator writes state directly; both hand every mutation to the Scribe so parallel sub-squad dispatch cannot race on shared files. Each sub-squad's writes stay inside its own root, so two sub-squads running in parallel never touch the same files.

## Relationship to Multi-Repo Federation (deferred)

This file specifies the **in-repo** federation. The **multi-repo** federation — a hub that coordinates one squad per repository — reuses everything here and only changes a sub-squad's `Kind` to `repo` and its `Location` to an external repository, plus a cross-repo execution driver. Its research and plan live in `.copilot-tracking/plans/2026-07-16/squad-federation-multi-repo-plan.instructions.md`. The `repo` kind is reserved but not seeded by the in-repo flow.

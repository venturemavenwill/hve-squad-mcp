# Squad State Conventions

These conventions define where squad state lives, who may change it, and how the squad's coordination tools map onto concrete HVE Core mechanisms. The Squad Coordinator reads this layout to locate roster, routing, decisions, and history; the Squad Scribe writes to it on the coordinator's behalf.

State is per-project and runtime-created. It is never packaged with the squad source — only the coordinator produces it under `.copilot-tracking/squad/` when a project first runs the squad.

## Squad Root (parameterized state root)

Every state path below is relative to a **squad root**. The root is parameterized so the same layout can serve either a single squad or a sub-squad within a federation:

* The default squad root is `.copilot-tracking/squad/`. When no root is supplied, the paths in this file are literal and behavior is exactly today's single-squad behavior.
* In a **federation** (opt-in), each sub-squad roots at `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`, and every path in this file is read as `<squadRoot>/...`. The Squad Coordinator and Squad Scribe accept an optional `squadRoot`; when omitted, the default preserves single-squad behavior.

The federation layout, the registry, meta-routing, detection precedence (`federation.md` → federation, else `team.md` → plain squad, else Init), and the two-level single-writer rule are defined in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`. The remainder of this file describes the state tree under a single squad root; it applies unchanged to each sub-squad root in a federation.

## State Layout

All squad state lives under the squad root (`.copilot-tracking/squad/` by default; `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/` for a federation sub-squad):

| Path                  | Purpose                                                                    | Write Semantics      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `team.md`             | Roster of roles and the agents that fill them (see roster conventions)     | Replace via scribe   |
| `routing.md`          | Request-pattern routing table (see routing conventions)                    | Replace via scribe   |
| `decisions.md`        | Chronological log of squad decisions and their rationale                   | Append-only          |
| `notifications.md`    | Chronological log of notifications (pings) fired and their delivery channel | Append-only          |
| `history/<agent>.md`  | Per-agent dispatch history: requests handled, findings, outcomes           | Append-only          |
| `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md` | Per-run autopilot pipeline summary: stages, gates, approvals     | Append-only by id    |
| `state.json`          | Machine-readable squad status: current turn, active roles, mode, notification contact, open escalations | Replace via scribe   |
| `consumption.md`      | Aggregated member/model/credit ledger; carries the cost comparison line    | Replace via scribe   |
| `consumption-rates.md`| Per-model token-rate table (USD per 1M) plus the comparison methodology    | Replace via scribe   |

* `decisions.md`, `notifications.md`, and the `history/<agent>.md` files are **append-only**. New entries are added to the end; prior entries are never edited or removed.
* Init seeds `history/` as an empty directory. Each `history/<agent>.md` is created by the dispatch it records, in the same write as its first entry, because the file's presence is the proof that stage ran.
* `state.json` mirrors the HVE Core `state.json` precedent: a small, machine-readable status document the coordinator overwrites as the squad advances. It carries the `notify` object (the captured notification contact) and the current `mode`.

### state.json Shape

The Scribe seeds `state.json` on first run and overwrites it as the squad advances:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.3",
  "updated": "",
  "turn": 0,
  "mode": "interactive",
  "activeRoles": [],
  "openEscalations": [],
  "currentRun": {
    "sessionModel": "",
    "modelOverrides": {},
    "estCostUsd": 0,
    "estCreditsTotal": 0
  },
  "notify": {
    "approvalChannel": "in-chat",
    "enabled": false,
    "email": "",
    "github": {
      "handle": "",
      "repo": ""
    }
  }
}
```

The `notify` object follows `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`: `approvalChannel` is `in-chat`, `github-issue`, or `webhook`; the `github` block is used only by the `github-issue` channel; and webhook URLs are never stored here. The `mode` field records the autonomy mode in effect for the current turn (`interactive`, `autonomous`, or `autopilot`). The `currentRun` object holds the run totals `estCostUsd` and `estCreditsTotal`, both seeded at 0 and overwritten by the Scribe as dispatches accumulate; they are per-run estimates, not billed amounts (see [Consumption Tracking](#consumption-tracking)).

**`state.json` advances on every turn that writes anything, not only at Init.** `updated`, `turn`, `mode`, `activeRoles`, and `openEscalations` all describe the turn just taken, so the Scribe moves them forward on the same hand-off that appends the decision and history entries — the three writes belong to one turn and a status document left behind is worse than an absent one, because it reads as current. Because the file has replace semantics, the advance is a read-modify-write: `schemaVersion`, `notify`, `trigger`, `currentRun.sessionModel`, and `currentRun.modelOverrides` are carried forward rather than reset to their seed values. The symptom of a missed advance is a `decisions.md` several entries long beside a `state.json` still reading `turn: 0`. In a federation this applies at both levels independently — a routed turn advances the sub-squad's `state.json` under `members/<name>/` **and** the federation's own at the federation root.

Watch Mode runs additionally carry an optional `trigger` object recording the event that started the run (`source`, `ref`, `eventId`, `actor`, `receivedAt`, `runId`). It is additive and omitted for interactive, autonomous, and autopilot runs that were not event-triggered; see `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`.

## Consumption Tracking

Squad runs estimate the model cost and AI-credit consumption of every dispatch so a project can see what a run spent. The billing model is GitHub Copilot usage-based billing (UBB): token-metered, effective 2026-06-01, priced per model in USD per 1M tokens, where 1 AI credit equals $0.01 USD. No per-dispatch token telemetry exists, so every figure is an estimate. The runtime exposes only a per-user aggregate `ai_credits_used` through the usage-metrics REST API, available after the fact for optional reconciliation.

The Scribe records consumption in three places:

* A per-dispatch consumption block appended to `history/<agent>.md` (append-only), one block per dispatch, written as an `#### Consumption` heading followed by a fenced `json` block, with fields in this order: `model`, `model_source`, `priced_as`, `model_tier`, `internal_turns`, `input_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `basis`. Numeric fields are bare numbers. The container is fixed rather than free-form because these blocks are the source the aggregated ledger is rebuilt from. **The block records consumption, not cost**: rates and money live in the two files below and nowhere else, and `priced_as` is what carries the pricing decision forward to the ledger.
* The aggregated `consumption.md` ledger (replace via scribe), which mirrors roster order and splits into two role-aligned tables so it stays readable at a glance: an **Attribution** table (resolved model, model source, tier) and a **Usage & Cost** table (estimated turns, tokens, cost, credits, basis), each adding an `orchestration` row for coordinator and Scribe overhead, the second totaling the run and carrying the cost-comparison line. This ledger is the common readme of members, models, and credits. **The file replaces, but its rows accumulate**: each rewrite is derived from every consumption block recorded in `history/*.md` for the run, summed per role, never from the current turn's dispatches alone. Deriving it from the turn in hand drops every earlier role while leaving its history entry intact, and the result still totals correctly — which is why the coordinator's Step 1 reconcile counts ledger rows against history entries rather than checking that the ledger is merely populated.
* The `consumption-rates.md` table (replace via scribe), the single maintainable source of per-model input, cached, cache-write, and output rates in USD per 1M tokens, plus the tier-fallback rates, the dispatch-size estimator, the calibration block, and the comparison methodology.

Model attribution — which model each block reports and how it is resolved — is governed by [Model Attribution](#model-attribution) below.

### Why a dispatch is not one model call

A dispatched agent runs an internal tool loop, and every internal turn resends the accumulated context. Cost therefore scales with `internal_turns × average_context`, not with a single input-and-output pair, and the accumulated context is largely billed at the cheaper cached rate. Pricing a dispatch as one call is the single largest source of undercounting in this ledger, so the estimator in `consumption-rates.md` models the loop explicitly and every block records the `internal_turns` it assumed.

**Orchestration counts** too: the coordinator's own turns and the Scribe's writes get their own ledger row, because they are real consumption that no dispatch block covers.

The Scribe computes the cost and credit estimates **once per ledger row**, from that role's summed token columns and the rates of the row `priced_as` names in `consumption-rates.md`. No history block carries a rate or a cost:

```text
raw_cost_usd = ( input_tokens       × input_rate
               + cached_tokens      × cached_rate
               + cache_write_tokens × cache_write_rate
               + output_tokens      × output_rate ) / 1e6
est_cost_usd = raw_cost_usd × calibration_factor
est_credits  = est_cost_usd / 0.01
```

### Calibration

Estimates that are never checked stay wrong. `consumption-rates.md` carries a `calibration_factor` — the running mean of `observed_credits / estimated_credits` across reconciled runs, clamped to 0.25-10.0 — that multiplies every cost estimate. When the coordinator supplies an `observed_credits` figure (the per-user aggregate `ai_credits_used` delta read from the Copilot usage-metrics REST API across the run), the Scribe folds that run's ratio into the mean and stamps the calibration block. Until at least one run has been reconciled the factor stays at 1.00 and the ledger carries an "uncalibrated" note.

Every numeric output carries an "estimated, not billed" disclaimer. These values support run planning and cost comparison, not invoicing.

## Model Attribution

The `model` field records **what actually ran**. It is resolved, never guessed. A ledger that reports a model the operator did not choose is worse than one that reports nothing, because it invites cost decisions based on a fiction.

### Resolution ladder

Resolve every dispatch's model by walking this ladder and stopping at the first hit. Record which rung produced the answer in `model_source`:

1. **Dispatch-reported** → `model_source: dispatch-reported`. The host named the model the dispatch actually ran on. Two forms count: the Copilot CLI prints it on the dispatch line as `AgentName(model-id)`, and an agent may state it in its own response. This is the strongest rung because it is an observation of what ran rather than a prediction of what should have run, and it is the only rung that detects a silent fallback.
2. **Agent-pinned** → `model_source: agent-pinned`. The dispatched agent's file declares a `model:` string and **both hosts honor it under a fixed session model** — a pin outranks the session model, including a headless `--model`. Read the agent file rather than guessing. Treat this as a prediction, not an observation, because two conditions void it: an entitlement gap makes the host substitute the session model (silently, on the dispatch path), and an `auto` session lets the router override the pin outright. A row resolved here is trustworthy only while neither applies, which is precisely why rung 1 outranks it.
3. **Operator declaration** → `model_source: operator-declared`. The user volunteered a model for this run or this role, recorded in `state.json` `currentRun.modelOverrides`. Never prompted for; recorded only when offered. It sits below the pin because a declaration states an intent the host does not enforce: an agent that pins a model runs that model regardless of what was declared for it.
4. **Session model** → `model_source: session-inherited`, or `cli-pinned` when the run is headless (a Watch Mode run, identifiable by the `trigger` object in `state.json`) and the model came from `--model`. This rung answers only for agents that pin nothing. `--model` sets the session model; it does not override a pin.
5. **Unresolved** → `model_source: unresolved`. None of the above is knowable, so `model` is the literal `unknown`.

Every rung is an observation or a file read — none requires asking the user, and none is a guess. Rung 5 should be vanishingly rare: reaching it means the dispatch reported nothing, the agent file was not read, and the session model was never recorded.

The host reports what it ran; prefer that over inference. Measured against the Copilot CLI: a valid pin beats `--model`; an unresolvable pin on a directly invoked agent warns and falls back to the session model; an unresolvable pin on a *dispatched* agent falls back silently. A ledger built on frontmatter alone will therefore look correct and be wrong on exactly the runs where an account lacks the pinned model. Capturing the dispatch line is what closes that gap.

### Never invent a model name

* `model` is either a model the ladder resolved or the literal `unknown`. It is **never** derived from a tier, a rate row, a roster preference, or a plausible-sounding guess.
* **`unresolved` is earned, not assumed.** Recording it requires that the dispatch reported no model, the agent's file was opened and carried no `model:` frontmatter, *and* `state.json` held no usable `sessionModel`. Every rung is an observation or a file read, so a ledger where every row says `unresolved` while agents plainly pin models on disk means the ladder was never walked — a defect, not a gap.
* Never copy the tier-fallback table's "priced as" model into `model`. That table names a model for *pricing* purposes only; writing it into the attribution field is the fabrication this rule exists to prevent.
* `priced_as` records the rate row actually used. It equals `model` whenever the resolved model has its own rate row, and differs only when `model` is `unknown` (priced at the tier fallback) or when the resolved model is missing from the rate table.
* When `model` is `unknown`, the ledger row and the run summary say so plainly rather than presenting a confident-looking name.

### A tier is not a model

`team.md`'s `Model Tier` is a routing preference. It never determines what ran and never appears in `model`. Two consequences follow, and both are common sources of surprise:

* An agent that pins `model:` in its frontmatter does **not** run on the operator's selected model, provided that selection is a fixed one. The Squad Scribe, Squad Reviewer, Squad Cost Manager, and Squad Technical Writer pin a lightweight model by design, so an operator running a high-capability model everywhere will still see those roles attributed to the pinned lightweight model. That is correct, not a bug — `model_source: agent-pinned` is what makes it legible. This holds in a headless Watch Mode run too: `--model` sets the session model for agents that pin nothing, and the pinned roles keep their pin. It does **not** hold under `auto`, where the router overrides the pin.
* An agent that pins nothing runs on the operator's model. If the operator selected a high-capability model, that dispatch must be priced at that model's rates, not at its roster tier's rates. Pricing an inherited high-capability dispatch at a mid-tier fallback is a direct undercount.

### Recording the session model

`state.json` `currentRun.sessionModel` is the single source of truth for rung 4, and it is captured **automatically, never by asking**. The coordinator runs *on* the session model, so it records the model it is itself running on — an observation about itself, not a fact it needs from the user. It re-reports on every turn, so a mid-run model switch is picked up without anyone announcing it. `currentRun.modelOverrides` optionally maps a role or agent name to a model the user volunteered; it is never prompted for.

Adding a build question here would buy nothing: the answer is already in the coordinator's possession, and a squad that interrogates its operator about facts it can observe is a squad that gets skipped.

**Normalize before recording.** A self-reported or dispatch-reported name is a display name and may not match a rate-table row exactly (`Claude Opus 5` versus `claude-opus-5`, or a version the table has not caught up with). Match case-insensitively, ignoring punctuation and a `(copilot)` suffix; when no exact row matches, fall to the nearest row in the same model family and note the substitution on the ledger. Record the reported name in `model` and the row actually charged in `priced_as`, so a stale rate table is visible rather than silently rounding attribution.

**`auto` is a routing mode, not a model.** When the host is set to automatic model selection, record `sessionModel: auto` verbatim — never resolve it to a concrete model name, because under auto the host routes *per request*, so the model can differ between two dispatches in the same turn. A single run-level model is wrong by construction here.

Auto changes which rungs can answer:

* **Rung 2 cannot resolve under auto — measured.** The router overrides a frontmatter pin. A child pinned to `Claude Sonnet 5 (copilot)` ran on `gpt-5.6-luna` on repeated `--model auto` runs, while the same agent under a fixed session model ran on `claude-sonnet-5`. A pin is deterministic only under a fixed selection; under auto it is a preference the router may disregard.
* Rung 4 cannot resolve. `auto` names no model, so it can never be copied into `model`.
* **Rung 1 is therefore the only rung that can answer under auto**, for pinned and unpinned dispatches alike. Under auto the host's dispatch line is not merely the strongest signal, it is the only one, which is why every dispatch is asked for it.
* A dispatch that reported nothing under auto falls to `unresolved` and is priced at its tier fallback. Flag those rows `auto-unreported` on the ledger and state plainly that they are the least trustworthy figures on the page: auto routes agentic tool loops toward capable models more often than cheap ones, so a tier fallback most likely understates them. The remedy is to get the report, not to guess a better number.

**Auto voids the roster's cost control.** Every lightweight pin — Scribe, Reviewer, Cost Manager, Technical Writer — is advisory under auto, and the router's bias toward capable models on tool-heavy loops runs precisely opposite to the intent of those pins. A run that must honor its pins needs a fixed session model. Say so plainly when reporting cost for an auto run rather than presenting the roster's tiers as though they held.

**The literal string `unknown` is not a valid `sessionModel`.** It is a placeholder that cascades: every agent without its own pin falls through to `unresolved`, gets priced at a tier fallback, and is billed as a cheaper model than the one that actually ran. A ledger whose rows are uniformly `unresolved` is almost always this failure, not a genuine ambiguity. `auto` is the correct value when the host is routing; `unknown` never is.

`basis` describes pricing; `model_source` describes attribution. They are independent, and both are required on every block. Each takes exactly one value from its own set — never a combined string such as `estimated, tier-default`.

### Sizing a dispatch honestly

The dispatch-class rows in `consumption-rates.md` are **floors, not fallbacks**. Start at the floor for the class and raise it with whatever the dispatch reported; never record below it.

This matters because of what the Scribe can and cannot see. The Scribe receives a short summary *about* a dispatch, never the dispatch's own context, so sizing from the summary measures the wrong thing and always understates the run. An agent's prompt plus its auto-applied instructions already exceeds most floors before it reads a single file, which is why a derived `gross_input / internal_turns` below the class `base_context` is a reliable signal that the floor was skipped.

Totals are computed by summing the rows, never estimated. The total row must equal its columns and the cost quoted in the comparison prose must be the same number as the table's total, because a ledger that disagrees with its own arithmetic discredits every figure on the page.

## State Ownership

Only the Squad Coordinator initiates state changes, and only the Squad Scribe performs the writes. Dispatched cast agents (Squad Researcher, Squad Lead, Squad Implementor, and the rest) return findings to the coordinator; they never write squad state directly.

This single-writer rule keeps shared state consistent across parallel dispatch: concurrent roles cannot race on the same files because every mutation funnels through the scribe.

## Proof of Dispatch

A `history/<agent>.md` entry is the squad's proof that a role actually ran. Because only the Scribe writes history — and only when the coordinator dispatched the agent and handed back findings — the presence of a per-agent history entry is verifiable evidence that the stage happened; its absence is evidence that it did not.

The coordinator and the pipeline gates treat history as the gate mechanism:

* A stage (discovery, intake, research, plan, council, implement, review) counts as complete only when both its domain artifact and a `history/<agent>.md` entry for the dispatched agent exist.
* Every `history/<agent>.md` dispatch entry MUST be accompanied by its per-dispatch consumption block (see [Consumption Tracking](#consumption-tracking)). A history entry written without its consumption block is an incomplete dispatch record: the Scribe always writes the two together, and the coordinator may not treat a stage as complete — or advance past it — when the consumption block is missing. This binds consumption to the same gate that already guarantees history, so a run can never leave `consumption.md` at its seed while history shows dispatches occurred.
* A missing history entry means the stage did not run, regardless of any narrative claim that it did. The coordinator may not advance past a stage whose history entry is absent — it dispatches the owning agent (or escalates) instead of synthesizing the stage itself.
* This makes the methodology checkable after the fact: every completed run leaves a research file, a plan file, a Council Verdict, change records, and one `history/<agent>.md` per dispatched agent, each carrying its consumption block. When the run's work was grounded in requirement or input artifacts, it also leaves an Intake Readiness Verdict in `decisions.md`; when the discovery gate ran or was offered and declined, it leaves a Discovery Verdict there too, plus a brief for any depth other than `skip`. If any is missing, the run is provably incomplete.

## Tool-to-Mechanism Mapping

The squad's coordination verbs map onto existing HVE Core mechanisms. There is no separate squad runtime; each verb is a thin convention over a deployed capability.

| Squad Tool       | HVE Core Mechanism                                                                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `squad_route`    | Dispatch the assigned role via `runSubagent` / `task` against a `user-invocable: false` agent            |
| `squad_decide`   | Append the decision and rationale to `decisions.md`; optionally record an ADR via the `adr-author` skill |
| `squad_memory`   | Write durable per-agent notes with the memory tool to `/memories/repo/squad-<agent>.md`                  |
| `squad_notify`   | Fire a notification per `squad-notifications.instructions.md`; deliver via a configured notification tool when present, else in-chat, and append the record to `notifications.md` |
| `squad_escalate` | Apply the escalate-to-user convention from the routing rules before any role acts                        |

### Decision Recording

* `squad_decide` always appends to `decisions.md` so the squad keeps a complete, ordered decision trail.
* When a decision is architecturally significant, additionally capture it as an Architecture Decision Record through the `adr-author` skill. The `decisions.md` entry references the ADR so the two stay linked.

### Memory Recording

Squad learnings live on up to three distinct surfaces: a consumer-local writable surface, a shipped read-only surface, and an optional tenant-internal read-only surface.

* `squad_memory` persists role-scoped learnings to the consumer-local `/memories/repo/squad-<agent>.md` via the memory tool, keeping squad notes in repository memory rather than ephemeral turn context. This surface is writable per consumer and is unchanged by the shared playbooks.
* Repository memory survives across conversations in the workspace, so durable squad facts (conventions a role discovered, recurring routing choices) belong here rather than in `decisions.md`.
* The squad skill's shipped `learnings/shared-learnings.md` playbook is the second surface. It travels as versioned package content, and the coordinator consults it as read-only, authoritative context. No run ever writes to it.
* An optional tenant-internal playbook is the third surface, present only when the organization configured the tenant APM dependency. It deploys to `.agents/skills/squad-learnings-tenant/tenant-learnings.md`, and the coordinator consults it as read-only, authoritative context after the shipped playbook and never writes to it.
* Consumer-local memory is never auto-promoted into either shared surface. Promotion is a deliberate, human-reviewed path documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, which keeps a maintainer review gate between a local note and shared content; that governance covers both upstream promotion to the shipped playbook and promotion to a tenant-internal repository.

## Watch Mode (DR-01)

Watch Mode — triggering the squad automatically on repository events (a new issue, a PR, a `/squad` comment, a schedule) so a run produces a pull request — is specified in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`. A Watch Mode run reads `routing.md` and appends to `decisions.md` and `history/<agent>.md` through the same single-writer Scribe path an interactive run uses, rooted at the **event-scoped sub-squad** the run executes in (`.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`) rather than the top-level squad root.

Watch Mode adds one backward-compatible state change: an optional `trigger` object in `state.json`, with `schemaVersion` moving to `1.2` (see [state.json Shape](#statejson-shape)). The object is additive — a squad that never runs in Watch Mode omits it — so existing state stays valid. The inbound approval half ships as the reference workflow `.github/skills/squad/github-approval-watcher.workflow.yml`; the outbound trigger half ships as the reference workflow `.github/skills/squad/squad-watch.workflow.yml`.

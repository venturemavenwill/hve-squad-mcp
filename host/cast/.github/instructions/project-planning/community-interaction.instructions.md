# Community Interaction Guidelines

Voice, tone, and response templates for community-facing interactions on GitHub. Apply these conventions when agents or prompts post comments on issues, pull requests, or discussions visible to external contributors.

Search for and apply `content-policy-citation.instructions.md` for every GitHub-visible title, body, or comment that references or alludes to a suspected content-policy or terms-of-service concern.

## Voice Foundation

Community interactions build on the conventions in `writing-style.instructions.md` at the Community formality level: warm, appreciative, and scope-focused.

Every comment posted via `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` is public and permanent. Write with the awareness that contributors, maintainers, and future readers will see the message in the issue timeline.

Pronoun conventions for community interactions:

* Use "we" when speaking for the project or making organizational decisions.
* Use "you" when addressing or acknowledging a specific contributor.

## Core Principles

* Thank first: open every interaction with acknowledgment, even when declining or closing.
* Scope, not quality: frame rejections around project direction, not the contribution's merit.
* Leave doors open: include a path to re-engagement in every closure message.
* Be specific: name what the contributor did. Generic thanks feels hollow.
* Be concise: target 2-4 sentences per response. Longer responses invite negotiation.
* Match CONTRIBUTING.md warmth: align with the "First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!" energy established in the project's contributor guide.
* Do not expose content-policy category names, rationale, quoted snippets, or paraphrased flagged content in public GitHub comments. Use the neutral template from the shared content-policy guard.

## Tone Calibration Matrix

Select tone characteristics based on the scenario category. This matrix guides template authoring and agent response generation.

| Scenario Category   | Primary Tone            | Secondary Tone                 | Emoji Use                      | Response Length         |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Welcoming/thanking  | Warm, genuine           | Specific, encouraging          | Permitted (brief, celebratory) | 2-3 sentences           |
| Celebrating         | Warm, celebratory       | Specific, encouraging          | Permitted (brief, celebratory) | 2-3 sentences           |
| Closing (scope)     | Respectful, direct      | Scope-focused, door-open       | None                           | 2-3 sentences           |
| Closing (completed) | Warm, confirming        | Specific, closure-giving       | Permitted (brief)              | 2-3 sentences           |
| Closing (inactive)  | Neutral, informational  | Reopening-friendly             | None                           | 2 sentences             |
| Declining PRs       | Appreciative, honest    | Criteria-focused, constructive | None                           | 3-4 sentences           |
| Requesting info     | Constructive, specific  | Actionable, time-bounded       | None                           | 3-4 sentences with list |
| Redirecting         | Helpful, brief          | Clear next steps               | None                           | 2 sentences             |
| De-escalating       | Calm, empathetic        | Boundary-setting, process      | None                           | 2-3 sentences           |
| Security            | Urgent, reassuring      | Process-focused, confidential  | None                           | 2-3 sentences           |
| Onboarding          | Encouraging, supportive | Mentoring, context-providing   | Permitted (brief)              | 3-4 sentences           |

Where emoji are permitted, place them at the end of a sentence or on their own, never mid-sentence and never as the sole carrier of meaning. A reader using a screen reader hears the emoji name inline, so a mid-sentence emoji interrupts the phrase it sits in. Text must remain complete and unambiguous when every emoji is removed.

## Scenario Catalog

Each scenario includes a trigger condition, a response template with `{{placeholder}}` syntax, a tone annotation, and the tool sequence for execution.

Template placeholders used across scenarios:

* `{{contributor}}` - GitHub username of the contributor
* `{{original_number}}` - original issue number (for duplicate closures)
* `{{pr_number}}` - pull request number (for completed issue closures)
* `{{specific_area}}` - description of the code area affected
* `{{specific_reason}}` - explanation for the action taken
* `{{specific_outcome}}` - impact of the contribution
* `{{criteria}}` - specific contribution criteria not met
* `{{time_period}}` - inactivity duration
* `{{question_1}}`, `{{question_2}}` - specific information requests
* `{{redirect_url}}` - URL for redirection targets

> If you have questions during implementation, feel free to comment here. A maintainer will be available to help guide you through the process.

Post via:

1. `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` with the welcome and context.

## Escalation Guidance

Agents should involve human maintainers when:

* Code of Conduct violations require judgment calls beyond template responses.
* De-escalation templates (Scenarios 18-19) prove insufficient to resolve the situation.
* Security reports require confidential triage and coordination.
* Contributor disputes involve technical direction decisions that need maintainer consensus.
* The agent cannot determine the appropriate response or scenario template.

Escalation follows the role hierarchy defined in [GOVERNANCE.md](../../../GOVERNANCE.md): Triage Contributor escalates to Maintainer, Maintainer escalates to Admin. Reference [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for behavioral standards.

## Integration Instructions

Community-facing agents, prompts, and skills bind to these guidelines two ways, and both are required because they cover different moments.

* Authoring time: the `applyTo` glob attaches this file when a live consumer surface is in context — the GitHub backlog prompts, the `Backlog Manager` agent, the `GitHub Backlog Executor` subagent, and the shared `backlog-management` GitHub reference.
* Runtime: each consumer names this file on a resolvable relative path at the point where it composes contributor-visible text. A bare file name is not a binding; it does not resolve.

Ownership is split across two components, and both need this file. `Backlog Manager` selects the scenario and prepares the sanitized comment text; it holds no GitHub write tools. `GitHub Backlog Executor` holds the comment and close tools, so it performs the post and the state change and owns the comment-before-closure ordering at execution time. Neither can satisfy the contract alone.

Current live consumers:

* [.github/agents/project-planning/backlog-manager.agent.md](../../agents/project-planning/backlog-manager.agent.md) — selects the scenario and prepares sanitized community-facing text.
* [.github/agents/project-planning/subagents/github-backlog-executor.agent.md](../../agents/project-planning/subagents/github-backlog-executor.agent.md) — posts the comment and performs the state change, in that order.
* [.github/skills/project-planning/backlog-management/references/github.md](../../skills/project-planning/backlog-management/references/github.md) — Community Communication section, which owns the comment-before-closure contract.
* [.github/agents/issue-triage.agent.md](../../agents/issue-triage.agent.md) — single-issue triage comments.
* [.github/agents/issue-triage.agent.md](../../agents/issue-triage.agent.md) — single-issue triage comments.

Templates are self-contained. Select the scenario that matches the trigger condition and fill the placeholders from the issue or PR context. Always post the explanatory comment via `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` before the state-changing call, so the contributor sees the reason before the change lands.

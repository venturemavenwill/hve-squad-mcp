description: Specialist review registry and package-aware gating for follow-up reviews.

## Purpose

Some review board items warrant a specialist follow-up. The review loop should surface those follow-ups only when the relevant signals appear and the required capability is available in the current environment.

## Signals-fire-only rule

A concern is surfaced only when its detection signals appear in the diff or the file surface. No specialist follow-up is offered when no matching signal fires.

## Gating behavior

- Detect the available agent, skill, or capability in the runtime catalog before surfacing a follow-up.
- Keep the main review flow intact when no specialist follow-up is available.
- Present each follow-up as an optional extension to the current review rather than as a mandatory extra lane.

## Selection rule

Offer a specialist follow-up only when it adds clear review value. If the backing capability is unavailable or no matching signal fires, leave the board item reviewable through the core code-review workflow.

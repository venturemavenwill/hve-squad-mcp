# WCAG 2.2 framework reference

This `SKILL.md` is the entrypoint for the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2** framework skill used by the Accessibility Planner and the Accessibility Skill Assessor subagent.

WCAG 2.2 is published by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative as a W3C Recommendation. It organises 86 active success criteria (plus 1 obsolete criterion, SC 4.1.1 Parsing) under four foundational principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) and 13 guidelines. Each success criterion is assigned one of three conformance levels: A, AA, or AAA.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/>.

## Licensing posture

WCAG 2.2 is published under the W3C Document License. This skill paraphrases success-criterion intent rather than reproducing normative text verbatim, in line with the paraphrase-preferred posture defined in `accessibility-license-posture.instructions.md`. Every per-guideline reference file cites the canonical W3C URL for each success criterion, and any future verbatim quotation must carry the W3C copyright attribution line specified in that instruction file. When that instruction content is unavailable, apply the paraphrase-only posture stated here and do not quote normative text verbatim, because the required attribution line cannot be confirmed.

## Success-criterion roll-up

The table below lists every WCAG 2.2 success criterion. The `Reference` column links into the per-guideline reference file using an anchor that matches the section header for that criterion.

## Assessment heuristics

Per-criterion assessment heuristics, common failure patterns, and scope notes live inside the per-guideline reference files in `references/`. The Accessibility Skill Assessor subagent consumes the appropriate `guideline-<n>-<m>.md#sc-<n>-<m>-<k>` section when evaluating a finding against a specific success criterion.

## Skill layout

* `SKILL.md` — this file (skill entrypoint and roll-up table).
* `references/` — one markdown file per WCAG 2.2 guideline. Each file contains the guideline statement, a paraphrased intent for every success criterion under that guideline, and a canonical W3C source URL.

## Guideline 1.1 — Text Alternatives

Guideline 1.1 (Text Alternatives) requires that every non-text element in the experience carry a text alternative that conveys the same purpose, so that the content can be re-rendered in any form that the user needs — large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Guideline 1.1, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#text-alternatives>.

### sc-1-1-1

**SC 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)**

Every non-text element exposed in the user interface needs a programmatically associated text alternative that serves the same purpose. Decorative or formatting-only elements may carry an empty or ignorable alternative so that assistive technology skips them, and time-based media, tests, sensory experiences, CAPTCHAs, and pure decoration each have their own narrower exception described in the W3C source.

**Applies to**: Images, icons, image buttons, image maps, charts, complex graphics, video and audio (for the placeholder text-equivalent), form controls, audio-only and video-only content (placeholder text), CAPTCHAs, and any embedded object exposed to the user.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm that every image conveying meaning carries a non-empty `alt`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby` that paraphrases the information conveyed by the image, not the file name.
* Confirm that decorative images carry `alt=""` or `role="presentation"` so assistive technology skips them.
* Confirm that image buttons announce the action (for example, "Submit application") rather than the icon name.
* Confirm that complex graphics carry a short text equivalent plus a longer description accessible via link or `aria-describedby`.
* Confirm that CAPTCHAs offer at least two alternative modalities (visual plus audio, plus a non-cognitive option where feasible).

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content>

## Guideline 1.2 — Time-based Media

Guideline 1.2 (Time-based Media) requires alternatives for prerecorded and live audio and video content so that users who cannot hear or cannot see the media can still receive the same information through captions, transcripts, audio description, or sign-language interpretation.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Guideline 1.2, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#time-based-media>.

### sc-1-2-1

**SC 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) (Level A)**

For prerecorded audio-only media, provide a text transcript that conveys the same information. For prerecorded video-only media, provide either a text or audio alternative that conveys the equivalent information.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm a transcript is available adjacent to or linked from the audio-only player.
* Confirm video-only media has either a narrated audio track or a text description that captures the visual narrative.
* Confirm the transcript identifies speakers and describes meaningful non-speech sounds when present.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-2

**SC 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) (Level A)**

Synchronised captions accompany all prerecorded audio content that is part of synchronised media, except when the media itself is a media alternative for text and is clearly labelled as such.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm captions are synchronised with speech, identify speakers, and capture meaningful non-speech audio.
* Confirm captions are an actual caption track (closed or open) rather than auto-generated speech-to-text without human review.
* Confirm caption playback controls are reachable by keyboard.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#captions-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-3

**SC 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level A)**

For prerecorded synchronised media, provide either an audio description of the video track or a full text alternative that conveys the same information as the combined audio plus video.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm either an audio-described version of the media is offered or a transcript that includes visual description is linked.
* Confirm the alternative covers actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text that are not in the dialogue.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-4

**SC 1.2.4 Captions (Live) (Level AA)**

Synchronised captions accompany all live audio content delivered as part of synchronised media (for example, live webinars, town halls, and streaming events).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm live captioning is staffed by a human captioner or a vetted real-time captioning service for any scheduled live event.
* Confirm captions are visible on the same surface as the video and remain legible against the underlying picture.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#captions-live>

### sc-1-2-5

**SC 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) (Level AA)**

Audio description of the video track is provided for all prerecorded synchronised media; a text-only alternative is no longer sufficient at Level AA.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm an audio-described track is offered either as the default audio or as a selectable secondary track.
* Confirm the audio description fits within natural pauses in the dialogue or that an extended description (SC 1.2.7) is offered.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-description-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-6

**SC 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)**

Sign-language interpretation accompanies prerecorded audio content in synchronised media.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm a sign-language interpreter video is offered in a regional sign language relevant to the audience.
* Confirm the interpreter window is large enough to read facial expressions and hand shape.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#sign-language-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-7

**SC 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)**

Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficient for standard audio description, an extended audio-described version (pausing the video to allow description) is provided.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm the extended description pauses the video where needed and resumes synchronisation cleanly.
* Confirm a control is provided to skip or speed through extended descriptions for users who have already heard them.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#extended-audio-description-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-8

**SC 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)**

A full text alternative is provided for all prerecorded synchronised media and for prerecorded video-only media, covering both dialogue and visual content.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm a full transcript is available that includes speaker tags, non-speech audio cues, and visual scene descriptions.
* Confirm the transcript is reachable from the same surface as the media.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#media-alternative-prerecorded>

### sc-1-2-9

**SC 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live) (Level AAA)**

An alternative for live audio-only content that conveys equivalent information is provided (for example, a live human transcription or sign-language interpretation).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm live audio-only programmes (radio-style streams, telephony bridges) offer a real-time captioning or transcription channel.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-only-live>

## Guideline 1.3 — Adaptable

Guideline 1.3 (Adaptable) requires that content can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure, so assistive technology can convey relationships, sequence, and meaning that sighted users perceive visually.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Guideline 1.3, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#adaptable>.

### sc-1-3-1

**SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)**

Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm headings use semantic heading elements with a sensible nesting order rather than styled paragraphs.
* Confirm data tables use `<th>` with appropriate `scope` or `headers`/`id` association rather than visual layout alone.
* Confirm lists, fieldsets, and landmarks use their native semantic markup.
* Confirm form controls have programmatically associated labels (label-for, `aria-labelledby`, or wrapping label).
* Confirm visual groupings (boxes, columns, bold headings) carry equivalent programmatic structure.

**Technique depth**:

* Tables (W3C technique H63): every header cell carries an explicit `scope="col"` or `scope="row"`. Markdown-generated tables emit `<th>` without `scope`, leaving association to assistive-technology inference, which is partial for single-header tables and fails for row-header and complex tables. For a build pipeline, inject `scope` on all header cells at build time rather than retrofitting source. Complex spanning tables use `headers`/`id`; layout tables carry `role="presentation"`.
* Table names (W3C technique H39, recommended): give each data table an accessible name via `<caption>` or `aria-labelledby`/`aria-label`, so it is announced on entry. A table with no name announces only as a grid of cells.
* Group names: give each visually-titled group (footer column, sidebar group, table-of-contents list) an accessible name that associates its title with its list, via `aria-labelledby` the title id or a wrapping `role="group"`/`<nav aria-label>`, so the group title is announced before its items.
* Faux headings: a section title produced by a CSS `::before` label, bold text, or a `<div class="*__title">` is not a heading element and is absent from the heading outline. Replace it with a real `<h*>` and move the styling onto the heading selector so appearance is unchanged.
* The table-name, group-name, faux-heading, and header-association outcomes are announcement-class: decide them with an accessibility-tree assertion or a manual assistive-technology pass per [at-announcement-model.md](at-announcement-model.md); attribute presence alone only informs 1.3.1.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships>

### sc-1-3-2

**SC 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A)**

When the sequence of content affects its meaning, the reading order is programmatically determinable.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm DOM order matches the visual reading order on left-to-right and right-to-left locales.
* Confirm CSS positioning (`float`, `flex-direction: row-reverse`, `order`) does not desynchronise visual order from DOM order in a way that changes meaning.
* Confirm tabular and multi-column layouts read in a logical sequence when CSS is disabled.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#meaningful-sequence>

### sc-1-3-3

**SC 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Level A)**

Instructions do not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as shape, colour, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm instructions like "click the red button" are accompanied by a text label ("click Submit").
* Confirm instructions that reference shape ("the round icon") add a non-sensory identifier.
* Confirm spatial instructions ("the menu on the right") include an alternative identifier.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#sensory-characteristics>

### sc-1-3-4

**SC 1.3.4 Orientation (Level AA)**

Content does not restrict its view to a single display orientation (portrait or landscape) unless a specific orientation is essential.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm the app, page, or media does not lock to one orientation through CSS, `screen.orientation.lock()`, or platform manifest entries except where essential (for example, a piano keyboard).
* Confirm orientation changes do not lose user input or context.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#orientation>

### sc-1-3-5

**SC 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (Level AA)**

The purpose of each input field that collects information about the user can be programmatically determined when the field corresponds to one of the WCAG-defined input purposes.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm fields collecting personal data (name, email, phone, address, payment) use the `autocomplete` attribute with the appropriate token.
* Confirm `autocomplete` values match the WCAG input-purpose vocabulary.
* Confirm autofill works as the user expects with the browser's stored data.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#identify-input-purpose>

### sc-1-3-6

**SC 1.3.6 Identify Purpose (Level AAA)**

The purpose of user-interface components, icons, and regions can be programmatically determined (for example, through ARIA landmark roles, `aria-label`, or microdata).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` or equivalent ARIA roles) cover the page.
* Confirm icons that act as controls expose a programmatic name and role.
* Confirm symbolic UI controls (icons) carry consistent and machine-readable purpose metadata.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#identify-purpose>

## Guideline 1.4 — Distinguishable

Guideline 1.4 (Distinguishable) requires that content be easy to see and hear, including separating foreground from background, supporting text resizing and reflow, and providing sufficient contrast for text and non-text UI elements.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Guideline 1.4, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#distinguishable>.

### sc-1-4-1

**SC 1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)**

Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm required form fields are indicated by text or icon in addition to colour.
* Confirm errors, warnings, and status callouts carry an icon or text label, not just a colour.
* Confirm chart legends, link styling, and stateful UI elements use a non-colour cue (underline, pattern, icon, text).

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#use-of-color>

### sc-1-4-2

**SC 1.4.2 Audio Control (Level A)**

If audio plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either provide a mechanism to pause or stop the audio or a mechanism to control its volume independently from the overall system volume.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm autoplaying audio carries a visible pause/stop control that is keyboard reachable within the first three seconds.
* Confirm a media player provides an independent volume control rather than relying solely on OS volume.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-control>

### sc-1-4-3

**SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**

The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large text (3:1), incidental text, and logotypes.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm body text reaches 4.5:1 against its background using a contrast tool.
* Confirm large text (18pt regular or 14pt bold) reaches at least 3:1.
* Confirm placeholder text and disabled-looking states that still convey information meet 4.5:1.
* Confirm text over images, gradients, or video uses a backplate or shadow that brings effective contrast to 4.5:1.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum>

### sc-1-4-4

**SC 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)**

Text can be resized up to 200 per cent without loss of content or functionality, except for captions and images of text.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm zooming the browser to 200% does not clip content, hide controls, or create horizontal scrolling on text blocks.
* Confirm text is sized in relative units (`rem`, `em`, `%`) rather than fixed pixels for body copy.
* Confirm fixed-width controls do not clip their own text at 200%. A recurring failure is a fixed-width search input whose placeholder truncates (for example, "Search" to "Sear") and whose keyboard-shortcut badge collides with the text. Replace fixed `width`/`height` with `min-width: 0` plus `clamp()`/`%`/`rem` so the field grows or the placeholder ellipsizes gracefully, let the shortcut badge wrap or hide near 200%, and keep images at `max-width: 100%`.
* This class is adaptive-rendering: decide it by rendering at 200% zoom (the `zoom-200` state), not by reading CSS. Static analysis only informs it.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text>

### sc-1-4-5

**SC 1.4.5 Images of Text (Level AA)**

Text is used to convey information rather than images of text, unless the image is essential (for example, a logotype) or fully customisable by the user.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm marketing banners, navigation labels, and instructional content use HTML text styled with CSS rather than baked-in image text.
* Confirm logotype images are the only allowed image-of-text exception.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#images-of-text>

### sc-1-4-6

**SC 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (Level AAA)**

Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 (4.5:1 for large text).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm body text reaches 7:1 contrast for AAA-targeted experiences.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-enhanced>

### sc-1-4-7

**SC 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio (Level AAA)**

Prerecorded audio that contains primarily speech in the foreground has no background sound, the background sound can be turned off, or the background is at least 20 dB lower than the foreground speech.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm narration tracks reduce or remove background music during speech.
* Confirm an alternative track with no background music is offered when background sound is desired.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#low-or-no-background-audio>

### sc-1-4-8

**SC 1.4.8 Visual Presentation (Level AAA)**

For blocks of text, users can select foreground and background colours, line width does not exceed 80 characters, text is not justified, line and paragraph spacing reach defined minimums, and text resizes to 200% without horizontal scroll.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm a high-contrast or user-themed mode is offered for long-form text.
* Confirm line length stays below 80 characters in the default presentation.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#visual-presentation>

### sc-1-4-9

**SC 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (Level AAA)**

Images of text are used only for decoration or where a particular presentation of text is essential (no general customisation exemption).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm even customisable imagery rendered with text is replaced with live text for AAA scope.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#images-of-text-no-exception>

### sc-1-4-10

**SC 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)**

Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions, at a viewport width of 320 CSS pixels (or 256 CSS pixels height for vertical scrolling content), except for parts that require two-dimensional layout.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm a 320-pixel-wide viewport (or 400% zoom on a 1280-pixel viewport) does not produce horizontal scrolling on text content.
* Confirm tables, code blocks, and large images may scroll horizontally only when two-dimensional layout is essential.
* Confirm an expanded control does not layer over adjacent content at narrow width. A recurring failure is a navbar search field that, when expanded at 320px, overlaps the site brand or H1 and clips its shortcut hint. Reflow the navbar to a single row-with-wrap (or stack the search below the title), collapse the search to its icon until invoked, remove fixed widths, and verify there is no two-dimensional scroll.
* This class is adaptive-rendering: decide it by rendering at the `reflow-320` state, not by reading CSS. Static analysis only informs it.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow>

### sc-1-4-11

**SC 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)**

Visual presentation of user-interface components and graphical objects required to understand the content has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colours.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm form-control borders, focus indicators, and active/selected states reach 3:1 against adjacent colours.
* Confirm icons that convey information reach 3:1 against their background.
* Confirm chart elements distinguishable by shape rely on 3:1 contrast for those shape outlines.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-contrast>

### sc-1-4-12

**SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing (Level AA)**

No loss of content or functionality when users override line height (1.5x font), paragraph spacing (2x font), letter spacing (0.12x font), and word spacing (0.16x font).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm injecting the WCAG text-spacing CSS does not clip text, overlap content, or hide controls.
* Confirm container heights do not constrain text such that the spacing override truncates content.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#text-spacing>

### sc-1-4-13

**SC 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (Level AA)**

Additional content triggered by hover or focus is dismissible, hoverable (the pointer can move into it without dismissing), and persistent (remains visible until dismissed or no longer relevant).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm tooltips, popovers, and submenus can be dismissed with the Escape key without moving focus.
* Confirm hover-triggered overlays do not disappear when the pointer moves over the overlay itself.
* Confirm the overlay persists until the triggering condition ends or the user dismisses it.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#content-on-hover-or-focus>

## Guideline 2.1 — Keyboard Accessible

Guideline 2.1 (Keyboard Accessible) requires that all functionality be available through a keyboard interface, without time-based input dependencies, so users who cannot use a mouse can operate the experience.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Guideline 2.1, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard-accessible>.

### sc-2-1-1

**SC 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)**

All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement (for example, freehand drawing).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm every interactive control receives focus via Tab order and activates with Enter or Space (or the role-appropriate key).
* Confirm drag-and-drop, hover-only menus, swipe gestures, and right-click context menus have a keyboard-operable equivalent.
* Confirm custom controls (`role="button"`, `role="checkbox"`) implement the expected key handling.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard>

### sc-2-1-2

**SC 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)**

When keyboard focus can be moved to a component, focus can also be moved away using only the keyboard, and the user is told how if a non-standard key is required.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm modal dialogs trap focus while open but release it on close (Escape or close button).
* Confirm embedded iframes, plugins, or third-party widgets allow Tab and Shift+Tab to exit them.
* Confirm any non-standard exit key is documented in the surrounding UI.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap>

### sc-2-1-3

**SC 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) (Level AAA)**

All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without exception for path-dependent input.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm freehand signature, drawing, or gesture inputs each provide a fully keyboard-driven equivalent path.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard-no-exception>

### sc-2-1-4

**SC 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (Level A)**

If a keyboard shortcut is implemented using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of: the shortcut can be turned off, the shortcut can be remapped, or the shortcut is active only when the relevant component has focus.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm single-key shortcuts are scoped to focused components, remappable, or have an off switch.
* Confirm modifier-key combinations (Ctrl, Alt, Cmd) used as shortcuts are not affected by this criterion but are still documented.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#character-key-shortcuts>

## Guideline 2.2 — Enough Time

Guideline 2.2 (Enough Time) requires that users have enough time to read and use content, including adjustable time limits and pause/stop/hide controls for moving content.

Source: W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Guideline 2.2, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#enough-time>.

### sc-2-2-1

**SC 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Level A)**

For each time limit set by the content, at least one of: the user can turn off the limit, the user can adjust it to at least 10 times the default, the user is warned before the limit expires and can extend it with a simple action, the limit is essential (auction, real-time event), or the limit is longer than 20 hours.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm session-timeout warnings appear before expiry with an option to extend by a simple action.
* Confirm timed quizzes and forms offer an accessibility-aware extension or alternative.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#timing-adjustable>

### sc-2-2-2

**SC 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)**

For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information that starts automatically, lasts more than 5 seconds, and is presented in parallel with other content, the user has a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide it (or to control its update frequency).

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm auto-rotating carousels and tickers carry a pause control reachable by keyboard.
* Confirm animated content longer than 5 seconds can be stopped without disabling the rest of the page.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide>

### sc-2-2-3

**SC 2.2.3 No Timing (Level AAA)**

Timing is not an essential part of the event or activity presented, except for non-interactive synchronised media and real-time events.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm any non-essential time limits are removed for AAA targets.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-timing>

### sc-2-2-4

**SC 2.2.4 Interruptions (Level AAA)**

Interruptions (notifications, alerts, banners) can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except interruptions involving an emergency.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm users can configure or pause non-emergency push notifications.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#interruptions>

### sc-2-2-5

**SC 2.2.5 Re-authenticating (Level AAA)**

When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authentication.

**Assessment heuristics**:

* Confirm forms preserve user-entered data through a re-authentication flow.

Source: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#re-authenticating>

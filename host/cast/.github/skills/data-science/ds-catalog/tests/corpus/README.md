# Fuzz Corpus Seeds

Seed inputs for the DS Catalog Atheris fuzz harness. Each file is raw bytes decoded as
UTF-8 and passed to `parse_catalog` through the single `fuzz_parse_catalog` target.

## Naming Convention

`{index}_{description}`. The harness has one target, so the index orders the seeds and
does not select behavior. Each seed exercises a distinct parser path.

| Seed                  | Path exercised                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `0_valid_frontmatter` | Well-formed catalog frontmatter    |
| `1_empty_frontmatter` | Present but empty frontmatter      |
| `2_unclosed_sequence` | Malformed YAML that fails to parse |
| `3_duplicate_key`     | Duplicate-key rejection            |
| `4_no_frontmatter`    | Missing frontmatter delimiter      |

# PowerPoint Skill Security Model

This document records the STRIDE threat model for the powerpoint skill (`scripts/build_deck.py`, `scripts/export_slides.py`, `scripts/export_svg.py`, `scripts/render_pdf_images.py`, and the `scripts/pdf_safety.py` helper). The model is organized by trust bucket: Sandboxed `content-extra.py` execution (B1), External converter subprocess (B2), Untrusted document parsing (B3), and CLI caller process and filesystem (B4). Each bucket enumerates all six STRIDE categories with the in-code mitigations that address them. Assets and adversaries are enumerated first. Acknowledged enterprise readiness gaps are listed at the end.

The skill builds and validates PPTX decks from YAML content, optionally executes author-supplied `content-extra.py` helper scripts to add advanced slide content, and exports decks to PDF/SVG/PNG using LibreOffice and PyMuPDF. The highest-risk behavior is **executing author-supplied Python**, which requires explicit operator opt-in via `--allow-scripts`; the second is invoking external document converters on potentially untrusted documents.

> **See also: repo-wide STRIDE model.** This skill participates in the repository-wide threat model at [`docs/security/security-model.md`](../../../../docs/security/security-model.md) and is registered in its [Skill Security Models](../../../../docs/security/security-model.md#skill-security-models) section.

## Executive Summary

The powerpoint skill builds decks from YAML, optionally **executes author-supplied `content-extra.py`** when the operator passes `--allow-scripts`, and exports via external parsers (LibreOffice, PyMuPDF). Its highest-risk behaviors are in-process execution of author Python (authorized by opt-in, then linted; no OS sandbox) and invoking large external document parsers on potentially untrusted documents. The skill holds no credentials and performs no first-party network egress; subprocess invocations use argument lists (no shell) and PDF inputs are bounded by `pdf_safety` before MuPDF parses them. Residual risk concentrates in sandbox-escape and external-parser CVE exposure.

## System Description

### Components

1. `scripts/build_deck.py` — builds and validates the PPTX from YAML; executes `content-extra.py` only when `--allow-scripts` is passed.
2. `scripts/export_slides.py`, `scripts/export_svg.py`, `scripts/render_pdf_images.py` — export the deck via LibreOffice and render images via PyMuPDF.
3. `scripts/pdf_safety.py` — bounds PDF inputs (size, magic bytes, page count) before MuPDF parsing.

| ADV-a | Hostile `content-extra.py` author content | **Defended by opt-in execution.** Scripts do not execute unless the operator passes `--allow-scripts`; a script present without it fails the build. When execution is authorized, an AST lint rejects blocked stdlib imports, dangerous builtins (`eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `__import__`, `breakpoint`), indirect-bypass builtins (`getattr`/`setattr`/`globals`/`locals`/`vars`/`delattr`), and attribute-form calls onto `builtins`, `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, and `importlib`. The lint is not a confinement boundary: an aliased module binding defeats it, and `pathlib` and `open` are permitted. See G-EOP-1. |
| ADV-b | Hostile or malformed input PDF            | `pdf_safety.validate_pdf_path` enforces a regular-file check, a 100 MB size ceiling, the `%PDF-` magic-byte prefix, and a 1000-page ceiling before any MuPDF parsing; C-level failures are wrapped in typed `PdfSafetyError` subclasses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Bucket B1: Sandboxed `content-extra.py` execution

### Spoofing

* Not applicable. The author script asserts no identity; it is trusted-by-policy input whose provenance is the operator's responsibility.

### Tampering

* Not applicable to the wrapper's own state. The author script's integrity is an operator concern; the skill lints it before execution but does not attest its source.

### Repudiation

* Denylist violations raise `ContentExtraError` and abort the build with a clear reason, so a rejected script is attributable rather than silently skipped.

### Information Disclosure

* An unauthorized `content-extra.py` never executes, so the default path cannot exfiltrate host data. Once authorized, the lint blocks network modules (`socket`, `urllib`, and more), but `pathlib` and the `open` builtin are permitted, so an authorized script can read local files. Egress would still require a permitted channel, but local disclosure is not prevented (G-EOP-1).

### Denial of Service

* A long-running or resource-heavy author script is not separately bounded; `content-extra.py` is treated as trusted, reviewed input and execution time is the operator's responsibility.

### Elevation of Privilege

* `content-extra.py` does not execute unless the operator explicitly passes `--allow-scripts`. A script present without that flag raises `ContentExtraError` and fails the build before the module is imported, so the default path executes no author-supplied Python.
* When execution is authorized, the script is linted against `_BLOCKED_STDLIB_MODULES` (filesystem, process, network, serialization, and introspection modules), `_DANGEROUS_BUILTINS` (`eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `__import__`, `breakpoint`), `_INDIRECT_BYPASS_BUILTINS` (`getattr`, `setattr`, `delattr`, `globals`, `locals`, `vars`), and `_ATTRIBUTE_CALL_ROOTS` (attribute-form calls onto `builtins`, `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `importlib`).
* **Residual risk:** the lint is not a confinement boundary and is not sound. A blocked module reached through an alias (`b = builtins`, `import builtins as _b`, or tuple unpacking) is not detected, and `pathlib` and the `open` builtin are permitted, so an authorized script can read and write the filesystem. Authorization, not the lint, is the control (G-EOP-1).

### Risk Rating

| Threat                                    | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status                        |
|-------------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Sandbox escape via author Python          | Low        | High   | Med           | Partially Mitigated (G-EOP-1) |
| Host data exfiltration from author script | Low        | High   | Med           | Partially Mitigated (opt-in)  |

## Bucket B2: External converter subprocess

### Spoofing

* The converter is located via `shutil.which` and known platform paths. Trust in the resolved binary's identity is an operator responsibility (G-TAM-1 covers the unisolated-parser surface).

### Tampering

* `convert_pptx_to_pdf` invokes `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir <dir> <pptx>` as an argument list with `check=True`; failures are surfaced, not silently ignored. SVG and PNG export paths likewise spawn the converter with argument lists and no shell interpolation.

### Repudiation

* Subprocess failures propagate as non-zero exits with surfaced errors so automation can attribute a failed conversion.

### Information Disclosure

* Not applicable. The converter operates on local files; the skill passes no secrets and performs no first-party network egress.

### Denial of Service

* A large or pathological document can stress the external converter; resource bounding is the converter's responsibility, and failures are surfaced rather than hanging silently under `check=True`.

### Elevation of Privilege

* The converter is a large external parser executed on the document with no container/seccomp isolation provided by the skill; isolation from the host is an operator responsibility (G-TAM-1).

### Risk Rating

| Threat                                          | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status              |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Converter parser exploitation on untrusted deck | Low        | High   | Med           | Accepted (G-TAM-1)  |
| Substituted / hostile soffice binary            | Low        | High   | Low           | Operator-controlled |

## Bucket B3: Untrusted document parsing

### Spoofing

* Not applicable. Documents are parsed as data; no identity is derived from them.

### Tampering

* `pdf_safety` enforces three cheap bounds (size ceiling, magic-byte prefix, page-count ceiling) before MuPDF parses a PDF, rejecting obvious non-PDF inputs. PPTX/OOXML is parsed via python-pptx with external-entity resolution disabled upstream, mitigating XXE.

### Repudiation

* Per-page render failures are surfaced as `PdfRenderError` rather than silently dropped.

### Information Disclosure

* Not applicable. Parsing produces images/structure locally; no secret material is read or forwarded.

### Denial of Service

* The cheap pre-parse bounds (size, magic, page count) constrain parser memory pressure before MuPDF touches the input.

### Elevation of Privilege

* PyMuPDF wraps the MuPDF C library, which has a non-trivial memory-safety CVE history. `pdf_safety` bounds the input but cannot eliminate native parser exposure (G-TAM-2).

### Risk Rating

| Threat                           | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| MuPDF memory-safety exploitation | Low        | High   | Med           | Partially Mitigated (G-TAM-2)          |
| XXE via PPTX                     | Low        | Med    | Low           | Mitigated (entity resolution disabled) |

## Bucket B4: CLI caller process and filesystem

The caller controls argv, stdout, and stderr; the CLI treats that process as operator-controlled.

### Spoofing

* Not applicable. The CLI runs as the invoking OS user.

### Tampering

* Output paths are operator-controlled; temporary files use `tempfile`. Converters run in headless mode without a UI.

### Repudiation

* Conversion and render failures surface as non-zero exits so automation can attribute outcomes.

### Information Disclosure

* The skill holds no credentials and performs no first-party network egress, so there is no secret material to leak.

### Denial of Service

* Not applicable at the wrapper layer; the caller controls invocation cadence.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Output directories are created with default permissions; the skill performs no privileged operation and persists nothing beyond requested outputs.

### Risk Rating

| Threat                                   | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status              |
|------------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Output path overwrite / unintended write | Low        | Low    | Low           | Operator-controlled |

## Enterprise Readiness Gaps

The following are known limitations recorded so operators can make informed deployment decisions. Severity ratings are the project's own assessment and are not equivalent to a CVSS score.

| Id      | Gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Severity        | Status                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| G-EOP-1 | An authorized `content-extra.py` runs in-process with no OS-level sandbox. The AST lint is not sound: an aliased module binding evades it, and `pathlib` and `open` are permitted. Execution is therefore gated on explicit operator authorization rather than on the lint. (audit: A-EXEC-1) | EoP-Med         | Treat `content-extra.py` as trusted, reviewed input before passing `--allow-scripts`; for untrusted authors, run the build in an isolated container or restricted account. |
| G-TAM-1 | LibreOffice/soffice is a large external document parser executed on the input deck with no container/seccomp isolation provided by the skill. (audit: A-CONV-1)                                                                                                                               | Tampering-Med   | Keep LibreOffice patched; run conversions in an isolated environment when inputs are not fully trusted.                                                                    |
| G-TAM-2 | PyMuPDF wraps the MuPDF C library, which has a non-trivial memory-safety CVE history. `pdf_safety` bounds the input but cannot eliminate parser exposure. (audit: A-PDF-1)                                                                                                                    | Tampering-Med   | Keep PyMuPDF pinned to a vetted range and monitor MuPDF CVE feeds; avoid parsing untrusted PDFs in long-lived processes.                                                   |
| G-SUP-1 | Runtime dependencies (python-pptx, lxml, PyMuPDF) are declared in `pyproject.toml` and hash-pinned via `uv.lock`; the external LibreOffice binary is operator-installed and unpinned. (audit: A-SUP-1)                                                                                        | SupplyChain-Med | Pin Python dependencies to vetted ranges; manage the LibreOffice version through the host's package controls.                                                              |

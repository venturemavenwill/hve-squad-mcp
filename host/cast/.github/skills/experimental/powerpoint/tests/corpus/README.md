# Fuzz Corpus Seeds

Seed inputs for the Atheris fuzz harness. Each file is raw bytes consumed by
`fuzz_dispatch` which routes `data[0] % len(FUZZ_TARGETS)` to one of the targets.

## Naming Convention

`{target_index}_{description}` where `target_index` matches the FUZZ_TARGETS
array position:

| Index | Target                          |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| 0     | `fuzz_resolve_color`            |
| 1     | `fuzz_hex_brightness`           |
| 2     | `fuzz_max_severity`             |
| 3     | `fuzz_has_formatting_variation` |
| 4     | `fuzz_safe_open_pdf`            |

## Usage

```bash
cd .github/skills/experimental/powerpoint
uv sync --group fuzz
uv run python tests/fuzz_harness.py tests/corpus/
```

Atheris loads corpus files as starting inputs for coverage-guided mutation.

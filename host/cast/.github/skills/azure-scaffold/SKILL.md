# Azure Scaffold

## Overview

This skill bundles the **documentation-only reference templates** a consumer repository needs to do
Azure work end-to-end — author Infrastructure-as-Code, deploy to Azure, and govern infrastructure —
the way a deployable template repo ships them. Because hve-squad is an
APM **package** (installed *into* a repo) rather than a template repo (cloned *as* a repo), it cannot
ship live pipelines. Instead it ships these templates and a consumer-facing agent copies them into the
consumer's repo on demand.

This mirrors the existing reference-template-in-a-skill pattern already used by the squad skill in
`.github/skills/squad/` (`mcp.template.json` and `github-approval-watcher.workflow.yml`): the package
never reads or writes the consumer's `.devcontainer/`, `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/`, or `infra/`
trees. The consumer owns every copy, merge, and commit.

APM install brings the squad's agent context into a consumer repo; it never writes the consumer's
`.vscode/` or `.devcontainer/` trees. The dev container and the MCP wiring are therefore turnkey
*through scaffolding* rather than automatic on install: a consumer-facing squad agent or the
coordinator performs an explicit, logged, consumer-approved copy (or merge) when asked. This keeps
the clone-and-go convenience of a template repo while preserving the doc-only, consumer-owns-config
boundary an APM package requires.

> **Nothing here runs from the package.** Each file below is an inert reference template. Activation is
> always an explicit, deliberate copy into the consumer repo followed by a reviewed commit.

## Bundled Templates

| Template                                                       | Consumer destination                          | Purpose                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [devcontainer.template.json](devcontainer.template.json)       | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`             | Dev container with Azure CLI + Bicep, Terraform + TFLint, GitHub CLI, Node.js, and Python.  |
| [mcp.template.json](../squad/mcp.template.json)                | `.vscode/mcp.json` (merge, do not overwrite)  | Recommended MCP servers for squad roles: Azure DevOps and Azure, plus optional GitHub and pricing servers. |
| [Setup-AzureOidc.template.ps1](Setup-AzureOidc.template.ps1)   | `scripts/Setup-AzureOidc.ps1`                 | One-time wizard: Entra app registration, OIDC federated credentials, RBAC, and GitHub secrets. |
| [deploy-bicep.workflow.yml](deploy-bicep.workflow.yml)         | `.github/workflows/deploy-bicep.yml`          | Bicep what-if + deploy via `azure/login@v2` OIDC (no stored client secret).                 |
| [deploy-terraform.workflow.yml](deploy-terraform.workflow.yml) | `.github/workflows/deploy-terraform.yml`      | Terraform plan + apply via `azure/login@v2` OIDC with an Azure Storage backend.             |
| [Get-PolicyBaseline.template.ps1](Get-PolicyBaseline.template.ps1) | `scripts/Get-PolicyBaseline.ps1`          | Read-only capture of effective Azure Policy assignments (with management-group inheritance). |
| [governance-baseline.workflow.yml](governance-baseline.workflow.yml) | `.github/workflows/governance-baseline.yml` | Scheduled run of the policy baseline that opens a PR when governance drifts.              |

## The `infra/` Folder Convention

Both IaC tracks live under a per-project `infra/` tree so one repo can hold multiple workloads:

```text
infra/
  bicep/
    {project}/
      main.bicep            # entry point (subscription- or resource-group-scoped)
      modules/              # local modules; prefer AVM modules (br/public:avm/res/...)
      main.bicepparam       # parameters per environment
  terraform/
    {project}/
      main.tf               # root module
      modules/              # local modules; prefer AVM (registry.terraform.io/Azure/avm-res-*)
      backend.tf            # Azure Storage backend config
      *.tfvars              # parameters per environment
```

The Squad Azure Architect's LLD table maps one row per Azure resource to one resource declaration in
`{project}/`. The Squad IaC Author converts that table into the files above; the deploy workflows then
target `infra/bicep/{project}` or `infra/terraform/{project}` by a `project` input.

## Scaffolding Flow

A consumer-facing squad agent (Squad IaC Author or Squad Deployer) or the coordinator scaffolds the
Azure layer into a consumer repo with these steps. The flow is copy-then-commit; the package never
writes these paths itself.

1. **Confirm intent and destinations.** Identify which templates the consumer needs and confirm the
   destination paths in the table above. Never overwrite an existing consumer file without showing the
   diff and getting explicit approval.
2. **Copy and rename.** Copy each template to its destination, dropping the `.template` / `.workflow`
   marker so the file becomes active in the consumer repo (for example,
   `devcontainer.template.json` → `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`,
   `deploy-bicep.workflow.yml` → `.github/workflows/deploy-bicep.yml`).
3. **Fill placeholders.** Replace every `<PLACEHOLDER>` token (subscription ID, resource group, region,
   project name, management-group ID) with the consumer's values. Leave no placeholder behind.
4. **Merge MCP servers (optional).** When the consumer wants the squad's recommended MCP wiring,
   merge the `inputs` and `servers` entries from the squad skill's `mcp.template.json` (the
   `.vscode/mcp.json` row above) into the consumer's `.vscode/mcp.json` rather than overwriting it,
   preserving any servers they already configured. Remind the consumer to reload VS Code so Copilot
   picks up the new servers. As with every path here, the package never writes `.vscode/mcp.json`
   itself: a consumer-facing squad agent or the coordinator performs the merge on request.
5. **Wire identity.** Run `scripts/Setup-AzureOidc.ps1` once to create the federated identity and
   populate the GitHub secrets/variables the deploy workflows consume. No client secret is ever stored.
6. **Enable PR creation (governance only).** For the governance baseline workflow, the consumer enables
   *Settings → Actions → General → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests*.
7. **Commit deliberately.** Stage and commit the scaffolded files in the consumer repo. Any actual
   Azure deployment runs only through the Squad Deployer, strictly behind the squad's
   Impactful-Action Gate.

## Security Posture

Every template follows these non-negotiable constraints (carried from the council verdict for this
capability):

* **OIDC only.** Authentication to Azure uses workload-identity federation through `azure/login@v2`.
  No client secret, PAT, or long-lived credential is stored in the repo or in the templates.
* **Least privilege.** The setup script assigns `Reader` at the management-group scope and `Contributor`
  at the subscription scope by default; narrow these to resource-group scope where the workload allows.
* **No embedded credentials.** Templates contain only `<PLACEHOLDER>` tokens and GitHub
  `secrets`/`vars` references. The setup script never echoes secret values to the console or logs.
* **Deploys stay gated.** Live deployment runs only through the Squad Deployer at the `confirm`
  autonomy tier, behind the Impactful-Action Gate defined in
  `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`. The package itself deploys nothing.
* **Read-only governance.** The policy baseline capture is read-only; it never mutates Azure Policy.

## Prerequisites (consumer side, when the copied templates are used)

* An Azure subscription with Owner or User Access Administrator rights to run the OIDC setup once.
* The Azure CLI (`az`) with the Bicep extension, and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated — both are
  provided by `devcontainer.template.json`.
* PowerShell 7+ to run the `.ps1` scripts.

## Troubleshooting

* **`No subscription found`** — run `az login` and `az account set --subscription <id>` before the
  setup script.
* **Workflow fails with `AADSTS700016` / `no matching federated identity record`** — the federated
  credential subject does not match the workflow's `environment`/branch. Re-run
  `Setup-AzureOidc.ps1` and confirm the `subject` matches `repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:<env>`.
* **`GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests`** — enable the setting in
  *Settings → Actions → General* (governance baseline workflow only).

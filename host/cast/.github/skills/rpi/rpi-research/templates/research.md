# Task Research: {{task_slug}}

Fill every `{{placeholder}}`. Update this file continuously during research, not once at the end. Sections wrapped in `<!-- <per_alternative> -->` and `<!-- <per_wave> -->` comments repeat, one block per evaluated alternative or research wave. Evaluate alternatives when the design space and requested output mode call for them. Delete optional sections marked `(when applicable)` that do not apply, and omit the guidance comments in the actual document.

## Research Parameters

<!-- Confirm scope and select one research posture before substantial research. Record whether the caller, an applicable codebase instruction, or the default selected it. Record every explicit limit or deadline without inventing additional ceilings. If a required field is missing and blocks progress, ask the smallest useful batch of clarifying questions, then proceed. -->

| Field                            | Value                                                                   |

| Known constraints / excluded sources | {{versions, licenses, sources to avoid, or research-only / no-handoff / analysis / audit / comparison boundaries}} |

## Extension Registry and Provenance

<!-- Survey extensions before research. Instructions match automatically by applyTo glob. Skills activate by semantic description. Research specialists require parent dispatch by stable frontmatter name and host visibility or registration. Use the precedence below and record selected and skipped candidates. Extensions can add scoped criteria or evidence, but cannot redirect phase, widen writes, grant tools, weaken safety, or silently decide for the user. -->

* Precedence: platform and host safety; caller scope and criteria; matching repository instructions and enforced schemas; rpi-research contract; domain skills and specialists; examples and preferences.

| Kind                | Candidate                        | Match and provenance                              | Scoped authority or output contract          | Selected / skipped reason      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Instruction         | {{instruction_filename_or_none}} | {{applyTo match against inputs or evidence path}} | {{criteria or schema added}}                 | {{selected_or_skipped_reason}} |
| Skill               | {{skill_name_or_none}}           | {{semantic topic or domain match}}                | {{on-demand knowledge used}}                 | {{selected_or_skipped_reason}} |
| Research specialist | {{stable_agent_name_or_none}}    | {{routing-description match and host visibility}} | {{independent-lane and output-contract fit}} | {{selected_or_skipped_reason}} |

## User Participation and Research Decisions

<!-- Use vscode_askQuestions only when answers materially change research. Batch a small number of decision-relevant questions, prefer fixed options plus freeform where useful, do not request secrets, and continue when interaction is sufficient, declined, unavailable, or unnecessary. Write the record before continuing. -->

| Checkpoint       | Questions or no-interaction rationale                       | Answers / unanswered      | Resulting decision or selected further research    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Intake           | {{topic_scope_criteria_or_priority_questions_or_rationale}} | {{answers_or_unanswered}} | {{resulting_scope_or_priority_decision}}           |
| Direction change | {{material_direction_question_or_rationale}}                | {{answers_or_unanswered}} | {{revised_brief_or_revalidation_decision}}         |
| Convergence      | {{further_research_defer_or_stop_question_or_rationale}}    | {{answers_or_unanswered}} | {{selected_items_deferred_items_or_stop_decision}} |

## Scope and Success Criteria

* Scope: {{task_boundary_relevant_files_constraints_and_exclusions}}
* Assumptions: {{assumptions_to_verify_not_trust}}
* Success criteria:
  * Every research question is answered or marked unanswerable with the missing evidence named.
  * Evidence is grounded in actual code, docs, or tooling results, with locations (`path:line` for code, URL + retrieval date for external).
  * Findings, decisions, and readiness claims cite Evidence Log IDs.
  * Alternatives are compared with trade-offs when the design space and output mode require it. A recommendation is selected only in convergence mode.
  * Open questions, risks, and residual uncertainty are recorded.
  * Self-check passes.

## Task Research Requests

* Explicit requests: {{explicit_user_requests}}
* Inferred research questions: {{inferred_research_questions}}
* Caller constraints and non-goals: {{research_only_no_handoff_analysis_audit_or_comparison_boundaries}}

## Direction Controls

<!-- Treat caller controls as active boundaries. Persist every material change before the next research action. Specific-only requests and exclusions constrain contrarian research as well as wider and deeper research. -->

| Control type (add / change / narrow / exclude / discard) | Direction or boundary | Source / checkpoint  | Effect on active brief, evidence, or revalidation |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| {{control_type}}                                         | {{direction}}         | {{user_or_evidence}} | {{remaining_work_or_complete_cycle_required}}     |

## Research Questions

<!-- Decompose the ask into answerable sub-questions ordered by dependency. Classify each to set fan-out:
depth = one topic, multiple angles; breadth = distinct independent sub-questions; straightforward = single focused investigation, do not over-delegate. -->

|  # | Sub-question     | Type (depth / breadth / straightforward) | Priority  | Status                    |
|---:|------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Q1 | {{sub_question}} | {{type}}                                 | {{H/M/L}} | {{open/answered/blocked}} |
| Q2 | {{sub_question}} | {{type}}                                 | {{H/M/L}} | {{open/answered/blocked}} |

## Prior Knowledge Gate

<!-- Before fresh research, check existing artifacts, memory, and supplied context. Treat them as starting points to verify, not ground truth. -->

* Existing artifacts reviewed: {{paths_or_none_found}}
* Reused (verified) findings: {{what_was_confirmed_still_valid_and_how}}
* Superseded / stale: {{what_was_outdated_and_why_or_none}}

## Research Cycle Log

<!--
Every executed cycle contains all three waves in order: Wider, Deeper, and Contrarian. A wave can contain multiple independent lanes, but each worker dispatch has one bounded lane, cycle number, and wave type. Reflection is a distinct step and is never parallel with the result it evaluates.
Apply the selected research posture and explicit limits or deadline. Do not add fixed cycle, token, source-count, worker-count, or time ceilings. Use evidence sufficiency, substantial novelty, scope coverage, source redundancy, and materiality to decide whether to re-enter.
The parent alone records accepted, rejected, and deferred material. Workers return compact evidence relationships and synthesis pointers without decision authority.
-->

## Evidence Log

<!-- The durable record. One unified log for code AND external evidence. Add rows as you go, not at the end.
Give every row a stable evidence ID: C1, C2, ... for codebase evidence; W1, W2, ... for external/web evidence.
Cite these IDs from findings, alternatives, decisions, readiness, open questions, and Advisory Next Step so every claim resolves unambiguously. -->

* Delegation: {{cycle_and_wave_annotated RPI Researcher or selected-specialist evidence files under .copilot-tracking/research/subagents/YYYY-MM-DD/, or "inline: fallback reason" when suitable dispatch was unavailable}}

### Codebase Evidence

| ID | Claim / finding | Location (`path:line`)           | Tool                                | Confidence       | Notes       |
|----|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| C1 | {{finding}}     | {{workspace_relative_path:line}} | {{semantic / grep / read / usages}} | {{high/med/low}} | {{context}} |

<!-- Group repeated code-search sweeps by search term in the Notes column when the search results materially informed the recommendation. -->

### External Evidence

| ID | Claim / finding | Source (title) | URL     | Retrieved      | Version/date | Confidence       |

<!-- Triangulate claims that depend on external facts across >=2 credible sources; prefer primary/official sources; note conflicts below. Separate sourced fact from inference. For code-only research, leave this table empty and write "No external sources used" in the Sources section. -->

### Contradictions / Conflicts

* {{claim}}: {{W1 says x; W2 says y}}; resolved by {{recency / consistency / primary-source}} -> {{resolution}}. (or `none`)

## Artifact Self-Check

* [ ] Every research question is answered or marked unanswerable with the missing evidence named.
* [ ] Every executed cycle includes Wave 1 Wider, Wave 2 Deeper, and Wave 3 Contrarian in that order, with no skipped wave.
* [ ] Research posture, provenance, explicit limits or deadline, and posture-specific completion basis are recorded.
* [ ] Every codebase finding carries a `C#` ID and a `path:line`; every external finding carries a `W#` ID with URL and retrieval date.
* [ ] Every `W#` resolves to exactly one entry in Sources and the list is gap-free, or Sources states "No external sources used".
* [ ] Findings, alternatives, decisions, and readiness claims cite Evidence Log IDs (`C#` / `W#`).
* [ ] The Extension Registry records matching instructions, relevant skills, available specialist subagents, provenance, authority or output contract, and selected or skipped reasons.
* [ ] User Participation records answers, unanswered questions, no-interaction rationale, decisions, and selected further-research items before work continued.
* [ ] Direction Controls record caller additions, changes, narrowed scope, exclusions, and discarded directions, plus any required revalidation.
* [ ] Parent Synthesis and Disposition records accepted, rejected, and deferred material with evidence-based rationale; workers supplied evidence relationships without decision authority.
* [ ] Cycle Re-entry Evaluation records whether a complete next cycle is needed and honestly records a limit-blocked gap when applicable.
* [ ] A recommendation is selected with why-rejected reasoning when Output mode is convergence; non-convergence modes record the decision state without a forced selection.
* [ ] Current Decisions and Unresolved Decisions contain complete status, source or owner, rationale or smallest missing evidence, evidence IDs, implications, and blockers.
* [ ] Potential Next Research includes priority, value, trigger, selected state, and related evidence.

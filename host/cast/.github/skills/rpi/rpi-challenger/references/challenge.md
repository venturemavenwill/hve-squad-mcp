# RPI Challenger Reference

## Challenge posture

Challenge examines a confirmed subject with skeptical curiosity. It tests what is assumed, bounded, evidenced, or undecided. It does not judge whether the subject is correct, validate its quality, prescribe an answer, or guide the user toward a preferred solution.

The active exchange is conversational rather than checklist-driven. A useful question follows the most material uncertainty in the subject or the user's prior answer. It may probe the same point, change angle, narrow the scope, or redirect when the evidence warrants it.

## High-value lenses

Consider lenses such as boundaries, intended outcomes, assumptions, evidence, dependencies, trade-offs, failure conditions, measurement, affected people, or time constraints when they fit the confirmed subject. Choose only lenses that can expose material uncertainty, and record coverage in terms meaningful to the session.

What, Why, and How are useful question forms. They help explore facts, rationale, and mechanics, but do not prescribe an order or limit a question to a formula.

## Adaptive questioning

After each answer, identify the most material unresolved claim, missing evidence, boundary, or decision. Ask one focused, open-ended question that helps the user examine it without implying an answer.

During active questioning, avoid recommendations, answer seeds, validation, praise, and recap. The scope-confirmation turn and final completion summary may state factual context needed to orient or close the session.

Move on when the answer has sufficiently clarified the current issue, the user redirects or skips it, or another uncertainty is more material. Record an unresolved item when a material point remains open instead of forcing additional probes.

## Record update protocol

After scope confirmation, create or resume `.copilot-tracking/challenges/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{task_slug}}-challenge.md` by copying the body of [../templates/challenge-session.md](../templates/challenge-session.md). Exclude the source-template YAML frontmatter so the generated record begins with `<!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->`.

Update the record throughout the session:

* Capture the confirmed scope, source of scope facts, related artifacts, and evidence basis.
* Maintain a flexible challenge coverage section that reflects the angles actually examined.
* Preserve claim-bearing user language accurately in the Q&A log. Condense greetings, repetition, and other nonmaterial wording without changing the claim.
* For every unresolved item, state the smallest missing evidence or decision that could resolve it.
* Record the session outcome and any advisory next options when the user concludes or the challenge saturates.

## Read-only boundary

The challenge record is the skill's only writable artifact. Do not edit product sources, plans, research, reviews, or implementation evidence. Do not invoke an agent, subagent, or another RPI skill. A final response may name an RPI skill as an advisory next option under user control.

## Conversation and closeout

Use concise updates only at material boundaries such as scope confirmation, a material record update, a blocker, or closeout. Explain the action and reason, what changed or was learned, important artifact links, and one point the user might otherwise miss. Do not dilute an active turn: it contains one focused, open-ended, non-leading challenge question without advice or an embedded answer.

Before a scope or closeout question, give the decision context, viable choices and consequences, evidence-backed recommendation when available, blockers, and relevant Markdown links. At closeout, report session status separately from the unresolved-item or decision state. Include coverage and unresolved items. Advise `/compact` only when stale output or completed questioning detail outweighs current context and the challenge record is current. When advising it, name the retained record. Otherwise omit compaction guidance.

For standalone use, advise an exact `/rpi-*` command only when an unresolved item needs a downstream stage. Do not invoke that stage. Otherwise state the no-handoff reason. When `rpi-quick` or a confirmed automatic RPI Agent session owns continuation, return the challenge record to its parent instead. For the challenge record and every other relevant existing artifact, use the two-cell row `| [actual/workspace-relative/path.ext](actual/workspace-relative/path.ext) | Short description |`, using that artifact's actual workspace-relative path as both link text and destination; omit unavailable files and render the table immediately before the final `## Next Steps` section. End with `## Next Steps`: state the exact eligible user command, active-parent action, blocker-clearing action, or that no user action is required. When compaction is warranted, tell the user to run `/compact` before the next RPI command; otherwise omit compaction guidance.

# Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the entrypoint for the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) skill.

The skill encodes the durable, structurally stable layer of MCSB — the control-domain taxonomy and a domain-grain crosswalk to NIST SP 800-53 and CIS Controls — so the Security Planner and Security Reviewer can map and assess Azure cloud resources against a consistent control vocabulary.

The skill deliberately does not embed the volatile layer of MCSB (per-Azure-service security baselines, per-service control IDs, Azure Policy mappings, and Defender for Cloud assessment specifics). That content changes on Microsoft's release cadence and is retrieved at runtime through the Researcher Subagent per [references/lookup-playbook.md](references/lookup-playbook.md).
## Version and stability

This skill targets **MCSB v2**, which Microsoft marks as preview and which supersedes MCSB v1. Content is version-pinned and retrieval-dated (2026-07-21). MCSB v2 replaces v1's Governance and Strategy (`GS`) domain with an Artificial Intelligence Security (`AI`) domain, and maps to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 and CIS Controls v8.1 (v1 mapped to Rev. 4 and CIS v8). Re-verify the taxonomy and mappings against the official source before relying on them for a compliance decision.

## Attribution

Reference content in this skill is original prose that paraphrases publicly documented MCSB structure. The MCSB v2 (preview) documentation this skill cites is published on Microsoft Learn from a non-public source repository and is governed by the Microsoft Learn Terms of Use, not a public Creative Commons license. The separate, older MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks repository is CC BY 4.0, but its benchmark spreadsheets stop at Azure Security Benchmark v3 (the pre-rename lineage) and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark v1; it does not contain the MCSB v2 (preview) content this skill cites. Because this skill paraphrases rather than reproduces upstream text, no verbatim-reproduction license grant applies; it cites the canonical source in each reference file. See [references/00-control-index.md](references/00-control-index.md) for the consolidated attribution.

# OWASP® Docker Top 6 — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the **entrypoint** for the OWASP Docker Top 6 skill.

The skill encodes the **OWASP Docker Security Top 6** as structured, machine-readable references
that an agent can query to identify, assess, and remediate Docker container security risks.

## Normative references (Docker Top 6)

# Secure by Design — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the **entrypoint** for the Secure by Design skill.

The skill synthesizes the **UK Government Secure by Design Principles** (10 principles) and the
**Australian ASD/ACSC Secure by Design Foundations** (6 foundations) into structured,
machine-readable references that an agent can query to identify, assess, and improve adherence to
secure-by-design practices across the software lifecycle.

# Index of Secure by Design Principles

This document provides the index for the Secure by Design principles.
Each entry synthesizes related guidance from the UK Government Secure by Design Principles and the
Australian ASD/ACSC Secure by Design Foundations into a unified principle area.

## Cross-reference matrix

Each principle document follows a consistent structure:

1. Source mapping — which UK principle and AU foundation the content derives from.
2. Description — what the principle covers and why it matters.
3. Principle checklist — observable indicators that the codebase or project adheres to the principle.
4. Controls and mitigations — defensive measures and implementation guidance.
5. Anti-patterns — common violations that indicate non-adherence.
6. OWASP cross-references — related OWASP Top 10 vulnerability identifiers.

# Security Reviewer Formats — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the **entrypoint** for the security reviewer format specifications skill.

The skill provides shared format templates and data contracts used by the security reviewer
orchestrator and its subagents during vulnerability assessments. Each reference file covers
a focused area of the reporting pipeline.

## Normative references

1. [Report Formats](references/report-formats.md) — VULN_REPORT_V1 template, diff mode qualifiers, and PLAN_REPORT_V1 template.
2. [Finding Formats](references/finding-formats.md) — Finding Serialization Format and Verified Findings Collection Format.
3. [Completion Formats](references/completion-formats.md) — Scan Status Format, Scan Completion Format, and Minimal Profile Stub Format.
4. [Severity Definitions](references/severity-definitions.md) — Standard severity level definitions for all OWASP skill assessments.

# Code-to-documentation mapping

This reference preserves the mapping used by the former drift checker and makes it
available to the new drift mode. For a documentable AI artifact, inspect its paired
asset reference page before the broader conceptual and contributor documentation.

The placeholder `<path>` preserves every directory between the artifact kind and
the asset name, including nested `subagents/` directories. A skill has one paired
page for its whole directory; changes to `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, or
other files in that directory all map to the same page. Root-level repo-specific
artifacts and deprecated artifacts are not documentable and have no paired page.

## Drift assessment heuristics

- Read the paired asset reference page first when the changed path matches an AI
  artifact mapping.
- Confirm the paired page exists, its generated regions describe the current source,
  and its authored usage sections remain accurate after the change.
- Review the additional conceptual and contributor documentation when behavior,
  invocation, file paths, commands, or options changed.
- Prioritize factual discrepancies over style concerns.
- If the change is purely cosmetic, skip it.
- If no documentation target exists for the changed surface, note that no drift check is
  required.

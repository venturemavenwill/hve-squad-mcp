# HVE Builder Workflow Contract

Use this reference to route an `hve-builder` request, dispatch the right workers, and resolve one overall outcome. The requirements catalog defines artifact quality; this contract defines control flow.

## Mode routes

Infer the narrowest mode that satisfies the request. Ask only when two plausible modes would grant materially different write authority.

| Mode       | Source write authority                                                       | Required stages                                                                                    | Completion intent                                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create`   | Create the approved targets and directly required support artifacts          | route, author, static review, behavior test, validate                                              | Deliver a new, usable artifact set                                                               |
| `improve`  | Edit the approved targets and directly required support artifacts            | baseline review, author, static review, behavior test, validate                                    | Improve behavior without changing the approved architecture unless the caller accepts the change |
| `refactor` | Edit the approved targets; preserve documented behavior                      | baseline review, author, static review, behavior test, validate                                    | Simplify structure while preserving the stated contract                                          |
| `replace`  | Replace approved targets after recording their intent and migration boundary | baseline intent capture, route, author, static review, behavior test, validate                     | Deliver a new architecture that covers the approved old intent                                   |
| `review`   | Read source artifacts; write review and test evidence only                   | static review, behavior decision for whether the existing target can affect model action or output | Return an independent quality verdict without source edits                                       |
| `validate` | Read source artifacts; write validation evidence only                        | validate                                                                                           | Run the host project's mechanical checks without source edits                                    |

The behavior gate has separate route-specific decisions. For mutating modes, it is satisfied-and-skipped for every minor or medium change. This includes frontmatter-only changes that do not change capability or behavior, and reference-only changes that update an agent, subagent, or skill name. Major changes alone dispatch `hve-builder-tester`. Record the required skip fields and reason. For review mode, ask whether the existing target can affect model action or output. A behavior-bearing target dispatches `hve-builder-tester` without a source-delta prerequisite. A no-runtime target is satisfied-and-skipped with execution `Not run`, verdict `Not applicable`, fidelity `Not applicable`, and an evidence-backed reason. Validation is required for every mutating mode and for `validate`; it is optional in `review` unless the caller asks for mechanical conformance evidence.

## Non-tool capability-surface control

Treat existing `agents`, `hooks`, `handoffs`, `model`, and other non-tool capability-bearing frontmatter as baseline behavior. In improve and refactor work, preserve that surface unless the caller explicitly requests a change or verified evidence shows a host incompatibility, native failure, security defect, or required capability gap within approved scope. In replace work, change it only as part of the approved replacement architecture.

Agent and subagent `tools:` configuration sits outside this control entirely, under the Tool-configuration boundary in `requirements-catalog.md`.

When evidence supports a non-tool capability-surface change, return to scope and route before editing, classify the change as Major, and run behavior testing. Without that evidence, a reviewer records an uncertainty or limitation rather than an actionable finding or exact replacement surface.

## Stage order and gates

1. Scope and route. Resolve targets, mode, requirements, write boundary, evidence root, artifact architecture, applicable repository conventions, and directly required support artifacts. Determine distribution scope: an artifact the host distributes through a package, plugin, or extension carries required wiring as support work, while an artifact deliberately kept repository-specific does not. Intake may classify caller-provided facts, known targets, and already-supplied extension metadata without research. Do not run an open-ended codebase scan at intake; route a need for one through step 3.
2. Establish the baseline. For `improve`, `refactor`, and `replace`, capture the current contract, non-tool capability-bearing frontmatter, and static findings before edits. Do not inspect agent or subagent `tools:` configuration. Read only already-known target files, supplied criteria, and required canonical references. These bounded lifecycle-stage reads are not codebase exploration. Skip the baseline for a target that does not yet exist; `review` performs its single static assessment in step 5.
3. Research and explore only when needed. When non-obvious reuse discovery, an extension survey that requires a codebase scan, another open-ended workspace exploration, or an unresolved decision-critical internal, external, or hybrid question could change architecture or acceptance criteria, route it through the sole `rpi-research` bridge in `stage-dispatch.md`. Apply that bridge's return and unavailable-entrypoint rules. On `Needs clarification`, use approved evidence or ask the caller; when the missing answer is decision-critical and cannot be inferred, stop Blocked rather than guessing. Do not substitute a direct worker route or local research contract.
4. Author. For mutating modes, dispatch a generic Medium-profile authoring subagent using `stage-dispatch.md` inside the approved write boundary. Give it the complete known in-scope source and finding set so it can apply one coherent authoring batch. It performs bounded reads of approved target files and supplied canonical references. A proposed type change, artifact split, non-tool capability-surface change, new support artifact outside that boundary, or newly required exploration returns to scope and route before edits continue.
5. Review and close static findings. For mutating modes and `review`, dispatch a generic Medium-profile static-review subagent in fresh context against the complete candidate. Do not provide author reasoning or the author log; provide known target files, purpose, requirements, and canonical criteria. Its bounded reads are lifecycle-stage work, not exploration. When the verdict is Revise and all findings remain inside the assessed boundary, apply the complete finding set in one correction batch, then run one targeted closure check limited to the original finding IDs and their acceptance evidence. Do not turn targeted closure into another full static review. Return to scope and route when architecture, capability, safety, acceptance, or the evidence boundary changed. Skip this stage for `validate`.
6. Test behavior on the final correction state. Continue only after static findings are closed. For mutating modes, classify every changed target before testing. For minor and medium changes, record a satisfied-and-skipped behavior gate. For major changes only, dispatch the `hve-builder-tester` skill with the intended reasoning profile, fidelity, isolation set, together set, requirements, and any eligible prior behavior report for a correction run. In review mode, do not require a source delta. Ask whether the existing target can affect model action or output. Dispatch `hve-builder-tester` for a behavior-bearing review target. For a no-runtime review target, record a satisfied-and-skipped behavior gate with execution `Not run`, verdict `Not applicable`, fidelity `Not applicable`, and an evidence-backed reason. When required review behavior cannot execute, record behavior verdict `Not available` and overall `Deferred` with the exact rerun condition. Skip this stage for `validate`.
7. Validate the final correction state. For mutating modes and `validate`, dispatch a generic Low-profile validation subagent using `stage-dispatch.md` after source artifacts are at their real paths and the approved correction batch is complete. Classify caller-named or already-known applicable non-mutating checks as `local` or `CI`; generic validation executes local checks only. A specifically requested named CI lane may run directly, while its specialized setup remains separate. Record CI evidence that did not run truthfully and resolve required missing CI evidence as `Deferred`. In `review`, run validation only when requested.
   * When distribution scope applies, a new or removed distributable artifact requires its wiring to be complete before validation passes: tracked path-and-license eligibility, synchronized root `plugin.json` membership including every declared subagent, the single prepared extension output, and plugin validation. Record wiring that is not applicable, with the reason, rather than omitting it silently.
8. Resolve. Apply the outcome resolver below. Re-enter authoring for an open original finding or failed final-state gate inside scope; return to routing for a changed assessed boundary; stop on Pass, Revise, Deferred, or Blocked.

Stages may run in parallel only when neither consumes the other's output. An independent `rpi-research` handoff can run beside baseline review only when it cannot change the baseline target set. Authoring, candidate static review, correction-batch closure, final-state behavior testing, and final-state validation remain ordered because each consumes the preceding source state.

## Stage model selection

The lifecycle uses generic subagent dispatches with a model selected at invocation time rather than named worker frontmatter. `stage-dispatch.md` defines the prompt and evidence contract. This keeps the stage isolated while allowing the parent to select a responsibility-appropriate profile.

| Stage                   | Profile          | Why                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authoring, review       | Medium           | Architecture, authoring, and calibrated review require judgment                             |
| Validation              | Low              | Known-check execution follows a bounded mechanical protocol                                 |
| Test design and grading | Medium or higher | Coverage and evidence grading require semantic judgment and must not sit below the executor |
| `HVE Artifact Tester`   | Target profile   | Literal conformance simulation runs at the tier the tested artifact targets                 |

Select the responsibility-appropriate profile, then choose the first model from that profile's canonical ordered list in `artifact-types.md` that appears in the user's available model list. The `hve-builder-tester` lead selects the executor profile from the tested artifact's own declared profile and raises design and grading to the higher of Medium and that profile. Record any profile that could not be selected because it was unavailable, and do not raise or lower a profile merely for convenience.

## Stage result vocabulary

Workers report execution separately from judgment:

* Authoring status: `Complete`, `Partial`, or `Blocked`
* Research and exploration status: consume the execution status returned by `rpi-research`; when activation cannot run because it is unavailable, record `Deferred` with the run-specific rerun condition.
* Static review verdict: `Pass`, `Revise`, or `Blocked`
* Behavior review verdict: `Pass`, `Revise`, `Blocked`, or `Not available`; use `Not available` only when required behavior execution is Deferred before grading, and record the exact rerun condition
* Behavior execution status: `Complete`, `Partial`, `Deferred`, or `Blocked`
* Mechanical validation result: `Pass`, `Fail`, or `Deferred`
* Validation display in `review` mode: `Not requested` when the caller did not request mechanical validation; this is not a validator result and does not affect the overall outcome
* Per-check validation owner and status: owner is `local` or `CI`; status may be `Passed`, `Failed`, `Pending CI`, `Skipped`, `Deferred`, or `Unavailable`. These fields do not replace the mechanical stage result.
* Behavior gate disposition: `Executed` or `Satisfied-and-skipped`. This is the single definition of the satisfied-and-skipped display fields: execution status `Not run`, verdict `Not applicable`, fidelity `Not applicable`, and an evidence-backed no-behavior reason. These display values are not execution or review results, and other sections reference this definition rather than restating it.

`Partial` means a worker produced usable evidence but did not complete its contract. `Deferred` means a required action could not run in the current environment and names the exact rerun condition. Neither is a pass.

## Change classification

Classify the requested source delta before the behavior gate. When mixed changes exist, use the highest applicable class.

| Class  | Decision rule                                                                                                                                                        | Behavior gate                 |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Minor  | Editorial, formatting, comments, link repairs, or frontmatter-only and name-reference updates with no capability or rule change                                      | Satisfied-and-skipped         |
| Medium | Clarifies, reorganizes, or adjusts existing workflow text without adding, removing, or materially changing a model action or output                                  | Satisfied-and-skipped         |
| Major  | Adds, removes, or materially changes a model action, output, non-tool capability-bearing frontmatter, write authority, decision rule, stage gate, or safety behavior | Dispatch `hve-builder-tester` |

For a satisfied-and-skipped gate, record the classification, the specific non-behavior reason, and the display fields defined in Stage result vocabulary. Static review and validation remain required for their applicable routes.

When a Major change targets an artifact that declares the High profile, the behavior gate runs at that profile. `hve-builder-tester` executes the artifact at High and raises design and grading to match. It falls back to a disclosed proxy run only when the High profile is unavailable in the user's model list, and a proxy run states that its evidence does not establish behavior at the declared profile. Do not report a proxy run as intended-profile evidence, and do not lower the artifact's declared profile to match an executed one.

## Overall outcome resolver

Resolve the run once, using the first matching row from top to bottom.

| Overall outcome | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Blocked`       | Scope, safety, target identity, decision-critical clarification, or required evidence is too ambiguous to proceed responsibly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Deferred`      | A required stage could not run; any required CI evidence has per-check status `Pending CI`, `Skipped`, `Deferred`, or `Unavailable` until the evidence becomes available or the requirement is no longer applicable; a required behavior verdict is Not available; or research, exploration, or behavior execution is Partial because an unavailable capability prevents completion |
| `Revise`        | A review verdict is Revise, validation is Fail, authoring is Partial, or an actionable acceptance criterion remains unmet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `Pass`          | Every required stage completed or was legitimately satisfied-and-skipped, every required review verdict is Pass, validation is Pass when required, and all acceptance criteria are met                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Never convert validation failure into Pass because static prose looks correct. Never convert an unavailable stage into Pass because another stage succeeded.

## Iteration and stop rules

* Iterate only on evidence-backed findings that can change acceptance. Do not require a fixed number of ceremonial cycles.
* Apply all approved findings for the current assessed boundary in one coherent correction batch. Run targeted static closure for the original findings, then run behavior testing and validation once against the final correction state.
* Repeat a full static review, full behavior design, or other broad gate only when architecture, capability, safety, acceptance, or the evidence boundary changed. A failed targeted check remains in the same correction cycle.
* Stop and report Deferred when the same unresolved finding recurs without new evidence or when the caller's declared budget is exhausted. Name the finding, attempted resolution, and rerun condition.
* Stop and report Blocked before any destructive, externally visible, or out-of-scope action that lacks required approval.
* Preserve human review checkboxes. Agents leave them unchecked.

## Evidence boundary

Default durable HVE Builder stage evidence to `.copilot-tracking/hve-builder/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/`. The parent allocates a unique `{{artifact_slug}}-{{stage}}-{{attempt}}.md` path before dispatch by scanning and incrementing the attempt suffix. Read-only workers gather evidence in memory and write their owned log once; workers that promise progressive logging update their owned log. Research and exploration artifacts belong to `rpi-research`; HVE Builder records only the bridge return needed for lifecycle routing. Use plain-text workspace-relative paths inside tracking files. The final response links durable user-facing evidence and preserves plain-text paths inside tracking artifacts.

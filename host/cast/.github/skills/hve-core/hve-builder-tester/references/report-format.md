# HVE Artifact Test Report Format

The `hve-builder-tester` lead merges generic evidence-grading findings into this durable report outside the sandbox. The report separates execution status, quality verdict, fidelity, and limitations so simulation evidence cannot be mistaken for native behavior.

## Action-category taxonomy

Every finding carries exactly one action category. These describe what the artifact's author should do in response to the behavior evidence:

| Category    | Meaning                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| improvement | The artifact worked, but a change would raise its behavior quality.             |
| adjustment  | A rule or wording behaved differently than intended and should be tuned.        |
| deletion    | An instruction fired but added no value or caused noise, and should be removed. |
| correction  | The artifact produced incorrect behavior and must be fixed.                     |
| miss        | The artifact failed to do something its contract required, a gap in coverage.   |

## Finding shape

Record each finding with a stable shape so the author can act on it directly:

* Action category, from the taxonomy above.
* The instruction-quality category or review-rubric dimension it maps to, so every finding is traceable to the standard `hve-builder` authors against.
* The target artifact and tested profile.
* Fidelity and evidence class: observed, simulated, or emulated.
* An evidence pointer into the test log: the turn, observation, or dispatch that shows the behavior.
* Severity: Critical, High, Medium, or Low, using the review-rubric scale.
* The smallest concrete change that would resolve it.

## Report structure

```markdown
# HVE Artifact Test Report: {{artifact_or_set}}

- Tested profile(s): {{High, Medium, or Low and model per target}}
- Run type: full | correction
- Behavior gate: Executed | Satisfied-and-skipped
- Fidelity: simulation | native | Not applicable
- Execution status: Complete | Partial | Deferred | Blocked | Not run
- Verdict: Pass | Revise | Blocked | Not available | Not applicable
- Sandbox: cleaned up | retained at {{path}}

## Summary

{{One paragraph: what was exercised, at what fidelity, what was observed, and the headline findings.}}

## Fidelity and limitations

{{State which actions were observed, simulated, or emulated; identify proxy-model use; and list claims this run cannot support.}}

{{When the executor ran above the Low profile, state that a higher-tier simulator may repair ambiguity a lower-tier run would expose, so conformance evidence from this run does not establish that the artifact reads unambiguously at lower tiers. This belongs in the durable report, not only in the sandbox log, because the log is removed at cleanup.}}

## Reuse eligibility

{{For a correction run, record the prior report status and verdict, open-finding state, design and scenario IDs, requirement mapping, prior and current target revisions, profile, model or proxy status, modality, fidelity, and changed-surface impact. State why each reused scenario is unaffected. For a full run, state Not applicable.}}

| Scenario        | Requirement                   | Impact disposition                     | Evidence source                     | Grade provenance                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| {{scenario_id}} | {{requirement_id_or_summary}} | {{affected_unaffected_or_untraceable}} | {{fresh_execution_or_prior_report}} | {{fresh_grade_or_reused_grade}} |

## Findings

{{Ordered by severity, Critical and High first. One row per finding.}}

| # | Action | Mapped dimension | Artifact | Profile | Evidence class | Severity | Evidence | Resolving change |
|---|--------|------------------|----------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|------------------|

## Coverage

{{Behaviors that ran as intended, and any contracted behavior left untested with the reason.}}

## Containment

{{Pre-run and post-run workspace status, enforced controls, and any unexpected side effect.}}

## Satisfied-and-skipped

{{Any target recorded as having no runtime behavior to exercise, with the reason.}}

## Human review

- [ ] Reviewed and validated by a qualified human reviewer
```

## Rules

* Order findings by severity, Critical and High first.
* Keep the finding set bounded and high-leverage; consolidate overlapping issues rather than padding the list.
* Use the action categories above tagged with the mapped standard dimension; do not introduce a retired taxonomy.
* Use `runtime` or `native` only for behavior observed through native fidelity. Use `simulation` for literal conformance execution and `emulated` for actions that did not run.
* A proxy-model run cannot claim target-model equivalence. An unexpected out-of-sandbox write prevents Pass.
* A correction run cannot reuse evidence unless every eligibility dimension is recorded. Untraceable scenarios are affected and require fresh execution and independent grading.
* Use Not available only when execution is Deferred before independent grading. Pass, Revise, and Blocked require grading evidence.
* Use `Satisfied-and-skipped` only for a target or change with no runtime behavior. Pair it with fidelity `Not applicable`, execution `Not run`, verdict `Not applicable`, and a reason.
* Never check the human-review checkbox; only a human converts `[ ]` to `[x]`.
* Cite `.copilot-tracking/` and sandbox log paths as plain text; use markdown links only for durable, human-facing files. The durable report is the source of truth for the behavior-test outcome.

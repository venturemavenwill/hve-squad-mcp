title: experiment-design provenance and attribution
description: Source map, reproduction scope, HVE Core derivations, and boundaries for the experiment-design reference pack
---

## Purpose

This file records where each part of `experiment-design` comes from and what is repository convention rather than upstream guidance.

## Licensing posture

This pack holds repository-original content and HVE Core guidance informed by upstream sources, both licensed CC BY 4.0. It reproduces no upstream reference text.

The pack previously carried two Microsoft CSE Code With Engineering Playbook references. Those moved to `ml-experimentation` when the ML-only material was separated from general experiment coaching. Their source map, reproduction scope, and licensing statements travelled with them and are recorded in that pack's provenance.

Microsoft CSE Code With Engineering Playbook documentation is licensed CC BY 4.0, which requires attribution and an indication that changes were made; `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` carries both. This repository's licensing posture is stricter than the license and limits reproduction to the minimum text necessary for a specific technical point. [experiment-readiness.md](experiment-readiness.md) satisfies that limit: it paraphrases throughout and reproduces no upstream passage.

MVE coaching content in this pack is HVE Core original material. It was consolidated here from a repository instruction file so that on-demand methodology has a single authoritative home.

## Precision worth preserving

* An identifier recorded without its version is a label, not a reproducible reference. Whether it names a dataset, a firmware build, a model endpoint, a container image, or a hardware revision, dropping the version turns a reproducibility requirement into a labelling suggestion.
* Consistency across inputs and evaluation is what makes experiments comparable. A tracking tool alone does not deliver comparability.

| MVE methodology, vetting criteria, red flags, and backlog bridge | HVE Core original coaching material, consolidated into this pack                                                    |
| Prioritization signals for choosing among candidate experiments  | HVE Core guidance. Upstream describes re-prioritizing after each share but does not enumerate selection signals.    |
| Generalizing spikes and trade studies beyond engagement work     | HVE Core framing. Upstream scopes both practices to customer engagements with named ceremonies and meeting lengths. |

## Where this pack is silent

* ML experimentation setup, experiment tracking frameworks, dataset and model abstractions, model evaluation flow, and ML checklists belong to `ml-experimentation`.
* Pipeline mechanics, data tiering, replay semantics, and DS/MLOps test technique belong to `ds-dataops`.
* This pack does not select a universal framework, tool, metric, or threshold. It requires that a team decide, document, and apply one consistently, and that decision depends on project context.

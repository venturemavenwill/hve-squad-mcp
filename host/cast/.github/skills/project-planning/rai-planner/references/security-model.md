description: Security model and AI STRIDE overlay usage guidance for Phase 4 of the RAI Planner
---

# Security Model Reference

Use this reference during Phase 4 when you build the RAI security model and prepare the Measure-phase threat addendum.

## Phase 4 overlay usage

Apply the AI STRIDE overlay as an extension of the existing security-model analysis rather than as a substitute for it. Start from the AI STRIDE Overlay reference in the `rai-standards` skill and use it to surface AI-specific trust boundaries, lifecycle risks, and human-review considerations that are easy to miss in standard software threat modeling. When that skill is unavailable, say so and continue with standard software threat modeling rather than substituting another overlay.

* Review each AI component across training, inference, monitoring, and feedback paths.
* Treat model lifecycle assets as first-class control surfaces, including data provenance, features, checkpoints, and retraining flows.
* Record whether a concern should remain as an RAI-managed finding or be linked into the Security Planner's bucketed analysis through the dual threat-ID convention.
* Keep the overlay usage tied to the Measure-phase artifacts: the threat addendum, control-surface catalog, and evidence register.

## Control Surface Catalog

Create or update a control surface catalog for the system under review. Capture each surface with its ownership boundary, current controls, evidence, and open gaps.

* Training data stores
* Model artifacts and checkpoints
* Inference endpoints and serving layers
* Feature pipelines and data preparation
* Feedback loops and retraining paths
* Human review queues and escalation paths
* Monitoring dashboards and telemetry pipelines
* Orchestration layers and agentic control flows

## RAI Threat Addendum

When you draft the RAI threat addendum, use the dual threat-ID convention and merge the findings into the Security Planner's bucketed analysis without losing either the RAI-managed or cross-referenced identity.

* Use `T-RAI-###` for RAI-managed threat IDs.
* Use `T-{BUCKET}-AI-###` for cross-references that connect to the Security Planner's bucketed analysis.
* Preserve both IDs in the merged output so the RAI analysis and the security plan stay traceable.
* Capture the affected control surface, trust boundary, concern level, and proposed mitigation for each threat entry.

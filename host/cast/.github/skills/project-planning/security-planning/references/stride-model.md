# STRIDE Model and Threat Analysis

This reference captures the STRIDE methodology, AI-specific extensions, and threat table conventions used during security planning.

Source: STRIDE threat model, Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle: <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-threats>

## Schema-aligned flow guidance

Use the existing schema fields documented in the TM7 generation reference rather than introducing a parallel model. For each flow, capture the structured `data_flows[]` metadata that reference defines as the canonical field set, and record why each value matters to the STRIDE analysis. When the flow carries business or personal data, also record the asset hints in `assets[].category` and `assets[].sensitivity` using the public classification guidance in the data-classification reference.

When reviewing or refining threats, record `threats[].state` as one of `Open`, `Mitigated`, `Needs-Investigation`, or `Not-Applicable-False-Positive`, and keep `threats[].target_ref` anchored to the relevant diagram element or component so the analysis remains traceable to the model. Cross-link abuse-case work to the related threat and mitigation evidence, and make sure each `abuse_cases[].evil_user_story` is captured alongside the abuse case so the adversary narrative stays visible to reviewers.

## STRIDE categories

* Spoofing — identity claims and impersonation
* Tampering — unauthorized modification of data or code
* Repudiation — lack of attributable evidence
* Information Disclosure — sensitive data exposure
* Denial of Service — resource exhaustion or interruption
* Elevation of Privilege — unauthorized access or privilege increase

## AI-specific STRIDE extensions

When `raiEnabled` is true, add AI-guiding questions to each STRIDE category for ai-ml components and AI-integrated components in other buckets.

Examples:

* Spoofing: Can adversarial inputs cause the model to impersonate legitimate outputs?
* Tampering: Can training data be poisoned to alter model behavior?
* Repudiation: Can model decisions be traced to specific inputs and model versions?
* Information Disclosure: Can model weights or training data be extracted through query patterns?
* Denial of Service: Can adversarial inputs cause model resource exhaustion?
* Elevation of Privilege: Can prompt injection bypass content safety guardrails?

## Threat ID pattern

Use `T-{BUCKET_ABBREV}-{NNN}` for standard buckets and `T-{BUCKET_ABBREV}-AI-{NNN}` for AI-specific threats in existing buckets when `raiEnabled` is true.

## Threat table format

| ID          | STRIDE    | Description                           | Component    | Likelihood | Impact | Risk     | Mitigation                                | Standards          |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|--------------|------------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| T-INFRA-001 | Tampering | Config drift via unauthorized changes | IaC pipeline | High       | High   | Critical | Immutable infrastructure, drift detection | CIS 5.1, NIST CM-3 |

## Risk matrix

Use the bucketed likelihood/impact matrix to derive directional priority ratings:

|                    | Impact: Low   | Impact: Medium | Impact: High |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Likelihood: High   | Low           | High           | Critical     |
| Likelihood: Medium | Low           | Medium         | High         |
| Likelihood: Low    | Informational | Low            | Low          |

## Data-flow analysis guidance

For each bucket, capture inbound, internal, and outbound flows, identify trust boundaries, and note sensitive paths that need extra control coverage.

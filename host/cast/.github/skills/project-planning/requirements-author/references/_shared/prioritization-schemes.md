# Prioritization Schemes — Skill Entry

## Overview

This skill documents the required MoSCoW prioritization scheme the BRD Builder uses for ordering requirements and business goals during Define. MoSCoW is referenced by name; this skill provides original Microsoft synthesis of when to use it, what inputs the workflow must gather, what outputs it produces, and which pitfalls reviewers watch for.

The skill is consumed by:

* the `BRD Author` skill (prioritization-section authoring guidance);
* the BRD Quality Reviewer (rubric for evaluating the prioritization section of a BRD draft);
* the BRD-phase instruction file for Define.

## When to Apply

Apply this skill in the following situations:

* A stakeholder asks "how should we prioritize this list of requirements?" during Define.
* A draft BRD contains a prioritization section that does not declare which scheme was used.
* The Define-exit rubric is grading whether the BRD's prioritization section is internally consistent and stakeholder-aligned.
* A handoff to PRD or downstream planning needs to surface the prioritization scheme as a structured field.
* A stakeholder is trying to decide whether a requirement is a Must, Should, Could, or Won't for the current delivery boundary.

## Required Scheme

The BRD Builder uses MoSCoW because it is widely recognized in business-analysis practice and maps cleanly to BRD and PRD handoff fields. When stakeholders have another scheme in mind, capture the rationale in `DD-###` and translate the final BRD priority field back to MoSCoW labels before Govern handoff.

| Label  | Meaning in a BRD                                               | Required author evidence                             | Common pitfall                                                           |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MUST   | Required for the agreed release or Govern handoff to be viable | Stakeholder owner, rationale, and impact if omitted  | Inflating too many items into Must without delivery capacity evidence    |
| SHOULD | Important and expected when capacity allows                    | Rationale and acceptance impact if deferred          | Treating Should as optional nice-to-have with no consequence             |
| COULD  | Useful but not required for the current boundary               | Rationale for lower urgency                          | Keeping Could items in scope without pruning during tradeoff discussions |
| WONT   | Explicitly out of current scope or release boundary            | Rationale and target revisit trigger when applicable | Treating Won't as never rather than not in this boundary                 |

The table is original Microsoft synthesis. The MoSCoW technique is referenced by name only; upstream source prose is not redistributed here.

## How to Apply MoSCoW

The BRD Builder applies MoSCoW in this order:

1. Establish the delivery boundary, time-box, or Govern handoff scope.
2. Classify each `BG-###`, `FR-###`, `NFR-###`, `CON-###`, and `BR-###` item with one MoSCoW label.
3. Record a short rationale for every Must and Won't item.
4. Challenge Must inflation by asking what breaks if the item moves to Should.
5. Carry the final label into `business_goals[].priority` and requirement metadata used by downstream PRD planning.

The BRD Builder records the chosen scheme as a structured field on the BRD so downstream consumers (PRD Builder, planners) can carry the categorization forward without re-deriving it.

## Supporting Lenses (repository-original)

MoSCoW records *what* the priority is. These lenses inform *why* an item earns its label, and are the evidence a reviewer looks for behind a Must. They complement the required scheme rather than replacing it; every item still carries a MoSCoW label.

### Impact versus effort

Assess two dimensions before assigning a label:

* **Impact** — how many users are affected, and how severe is their pain?
* **Effort** — what is the implementation complexity relative to current team capacity?

| Combination              | Typical disposition                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High impact, low effort  | Ships first; a strong Must candidate                                    |
| High impact, high effort | Decompose into incremental deliverables rather than deferring wholesale |
| Low impact, low effort   | Could, unless it unblocks something larger                              |
| Low impact, high effort  | Deprioritized or declined, with the rationale recorded                  |

The high-impact, high-effort row is the one most often mishandled. Deferring the whole item loses the impact; forcing it into one delivery boundary inflates the Must list. Decomposition preserves both.

### Business alignment

Ask whether the item advances a stated business objective or key result. An item with no traceable alignment is a Could at best, regardless of how enthusiastically it is requested.

### Cost of delay

Ask what the cost is if this is deferred one delivery boundary. Cost of delay separates a genuine Must from an urgent-feeling Should: an item whose cost of delay is low is a Should even when a stakeholder wants it now, and an item whose cost of delay compounds is a Must even when it seems small.

Record the cost-of-delay rationale for every Must and every Won't, since those are the two labels a reviewer is most likely to challenge.

### Communicating the outcome

When declining or deferring, state the trade-off transparently: what was chosen instead, and why. A declined item with a recorded rationale can be revisited; one declined silently returns as the same request next boundary.

# {{title}}

> **{{brd_id}}** | Status: {{status}} | Version: {{version}} | Last Updated: {{last_updated}}

## Executive Summary

{{executive_summary_content}}

*Guidance*: Summarize the business case, strategic drivers, key decisions, and scope boundaries in 3-5 paragraphs. Include the primary success metric.

---

## Business Context

{{business_context_content}}

*Guidance*: Describe market conditions, competitive landscape, organizational strategy, and external constraints influencing this initiative.

---

## Stakeholders

{{stakeholders_list}}

*Guidance*: Identify stakeholders using the Mendelow Power/Interest matrix. For each stakeholder:

- Name / Role
- Power (High / Medium / Low)
- Interest (High / Medium / Low)
- Engagement Strategy

See [stakeholder-analysis.md](../../references/_shared/stakeholder-analysis.md) for Mendelow matrix patterns.

---

## Design Decisions

{{design_decisions}}

*Guidance*: Record material authoring or scope decisions with `DD-###` identifiers from [design-decisions.md](../../references/_shared/design-decisions.md). Example: `DD-008` records a decision that affects scope, traceability, prioritization, or downstream PRD interpretation.

---

## Business Goals

{{business_goals}}

*Guidance*: List business goals with `BG-###` identifiers and SMART framing. Example format:

```text
BG-001: Reduce average claim adjudication time by 30% within 12 months of launch.
Priority: MUST
KPI: 30-day rolling average adjudication time.
Baseline: 10 days measured over the trailing 90 days.
Target: 7 days.
Timeframe: Within 12 months of launch.
Measurement source: Claims Operations adjudication dashboard.
Owner: Claims Operations Lead.
```

Use [id-schema.md](../../references/_shared/id-schema.md) for identifier prefix and digit rules.

**SMART Evaluation** (assessed at Define→Govern gate per `requirements-definition` skill):

- [ ] **S**pecific: Clearly defined without ambiguity
- [ ] **M**easurable: Contains quantifiable success metrics
- [ ] **A**chievable: Realistic given resources and constraints
- [ ] **R**elevant: Aligned with organizational strategy
- [ ] **T**ime-bound: Includes explicit deadline

**Status**: {{business_goal_smart_status}} (populated at Define→Govern assessment)

### Outcome Hypothesis Handoff Provenance

{{outcome_hypothesis_handoff_provenance}}

*Guidance*: When Discover ingests
`OUTCOME_HYPOTHESIS_TO_BRD_HANDOFF_V1`, record:

| Handoff ID | Source artifact | Source SHA-256 | KPI measurement source  | Receipt status |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| `<ID>`     | `<Path>`        | `<Hash>`       | `<System or dashboard>` | `<Accepted>`   |

Record one disposition row for each imported goal field:

| Field                                                                            | Source value | Disposition            | Current BRD value | Revision rationale        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `<Statement / KPI / Baseline / Target / Timeframe / Measurement source / Owner>` | `<Original>` | `<Accepted / Revised>` | `<Current>`       | `<Required when revised>` |

The BRD becomes authoritative after Discover exits. A later source change
requires a new handoff and explicit Discover re-entry.

---

## Business Rules

{{business_rules}}

*Guidance*: List standing business rules as `BR-###` items. A business rule is a policy, regulatory obligation, or operating rule the solution must uphold and that typically outlives this solution. Use [id-schema.md](../../references/_shared/id-schema.md) for identifier prefix and digit rules. Each rule records:

* `BR-###`: Rule statement.
* Category: Policy, regulatory, contractual, or operational.
* Rationale: Why this rule exists.
* Enforceability: Mandatory or advisory.
* Enforcing FRs: `FR-###` identifiers when known.

---

## Functional Requirements

{{functional_requirements}}

*Guidance*: List user-facing and system capabilities as `FR-###` items. Use [id-schema.md](../../references/_shared/id-schema.md) for identifier prefix and digit rules. Each requirement records:

- FR-###: Requirement statement
- Actor: Who uses this capability
- Trigger: When/how capability is invoked
- Expected Outcome: What the system does
* Acceptance Criteria: Link to `AC-###` items.
* Business Goals: Link to supported `BG-###` items.

Quality assessment per `requirements-definition` skill applies the nine ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §5.2.5 characteristics (necessary, appropriate, unambiguous, complete, singular, feasible, verifiable, correct, conforming).

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

*Organized by ISO/IEC 25010 Quality Characteristics (per `requirements-definition` skill)*

### Functional Suitability

{{nfr_functional_suitability}}

*Guidance*: Capability appropriateness, accuracy, interoperability, compliance. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Performance Efficiency

{{nfr_performance_efficiency}}

*Guidance*: Time behavior, resource utilization. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Compatibility

{{nfr_compatibility}}

*Guidance*: Coexistence with other systems, interoperability. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Usability

{{nfr_usability}}

*Guidance*: Learnability, user guidance, accessibility. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Reliability

{{nfr_reliability}}

*Guidance*: Maturity, availability, fault tolerance, recoverability. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Security

{{nfr_security}}

*Guidance*: Confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Maintainability

{{nfr_maintainability}}

*Guidance*: Modularity, reusability, analyzability, modifiability, testability. NFR-### items as needed.

---

### Portability

{{nfr_portability}}

*Guidance*: Adaptability, installability, replaceability. NFR-### items as needed.

---

## Constraints

{{constraints}}

*Guidance*: List imposed, non-negotiable boundaries as `CON-###` items. Constraints are not standing business rules. They bound the solution, delivery, or operating environment. Use [id-schema.md](../../references/_shared/id-schema.md) for identifier prefix and digit rules.

Each constraint records:

* `CON-###`: Constraint statement.
* Imposing source: Regulation, contract, platform standard, fixed external system, budget, timeline, staffing, or governance body.
* Affected boundary: Scope, timeline, budget, technology, integration, operations, compliance, or organization.
* Non-negotiability: Why the boundary cannot be changed within this BRD scope.
* Category: Regulatory, contractual, technical, financial, schedule, organizational, or operational.
* Impact: Requirement, design, delivery, or acceptance effect.

---

## Process Models

{{diagram_fragment}}

*Guidance*: This section resolves at template-fill time to one of:

* `diagram-mermaid.md`: Mermaid flowchart or related Mermaid diagram, the default.
* `diagram-ascii.md`: ASCII process diagram for low-fidelity Discover sketches.
* Omitted entirely when `diagram_format: none`.

The diagram illustrates key business or technical processes central to this BRD. Do not mandate external diagram tools from the BRD template.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptance_criteria}}

*Guidance*: Testable conditions for requirement completion as `AC-###` items. Use [id-schema.md](../../references/_shared/id-schema.md) for identifier prefix and digit rules.

Each acceptance criterion:

* `AC-###`: Given [context], When [action], Then [expected outcome].
* Covers: `FR-###` identifiers.
* Status: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, or Blocked.

Patterns from `requirements-definition` skill: Gherkin Given/When/Then format preferred.

---

## Traceability Matrix

*Guidance*: Maintain the traceability matrix as part of the BRD. Use [traceability-matrix.md](../../references/_shared/traceability-matrix.md) for the canonical table shapes and formulas.

### FR-to-AC Coverage

{{fr_to_ac_traceability_table}}

Coverage formula: `(count of FR rows with one or more AC links / count of FR rows) * 100`.

If the BRD has zero FR rows, report `0.0%` coverage. Treat the result as a caution when the BRD is intentionally non-functional-only and as blocking when the active threshold requires functional scope.

### FR-to-BG Alignment

{{fr_to_bg_traceability_table}}

Coverage formula: `(count of FR rows with one or more BG links / count of FR rows) * 100`.

Target: `100.0%`. Any gap requires an active waiver in `signoff.waivers[]` before Govern handoff.

### BR-to-FR Enforcement

{{br_to_fr_traceability_table}}

Use this view to show which functional requirements enforce standing business rules. `(none)` is allowed only when the BR is enforced outside the BRD solution scope or the missing FR is captured as an open item.

---

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

{{assumptions}}

*Guidance*: List assumptions about stakeholders, resources, dependencies,
technical feasibility, and other load-bearing beliefs. Preserve imported
outcome-hypothesis IDs and evidence status.

| ID     | Assumption    | Evidence status                                | Impact if false | Mitigation     | Source                          |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| `<ID>` | `<Statement>` | `<Untested / Partially supported / Evidenced>` | `<Impact>`      | `<Mitigation>` | `<Handoff ID or BRD discovery>` |

### Risk Register

{{risks}}

*Guidance*: Identify risks that could impact BRD realization. For each:

* Risk statement.
* Probability: High, medium, or low.
* Impact: High, medium, or low.
* Mitigation action.

---

## Open Questions

{{open_questions}}

*Guidance*: Preserve imported question fields and manage status in the BRD.
Discover initializes imported questions to `Open` unless it explicitly
confirms another status. Every `Deferred` row requires a rationale for
deferral and a target phase selected from `PRD`, `Implementation`,
`Operations`, or `Future-Release`. Populate both fields before emitting
`BRD_TO_PRD_HANDOFF_V1`; do not invent them downstream.

| ID     | Question or gap     | Why it matters | Owner              | Target date    | Status                         | Rationale for deferral     | Target phase                                           | Source                          |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `<ID>` | `<Question or gap>` | `<Impact>`     | `<Person or role>` | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` | `<Open / Resolved / Deferred>` | `<Required when Deferred>` | `<PRD / Implementation / Operations / Future-Release>` | `<Handoff ID or BRD discovery>` |

---

## Glossary

{{glossary}}

*Guidance*: Domain-specific terminology and abbreviations. For each term:

* Term or abbreviation.
* Definition.
* Context or examples.

---

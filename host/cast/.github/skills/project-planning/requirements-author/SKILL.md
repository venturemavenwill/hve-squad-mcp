# Requirements Author Skill

## Overview

This skill defines how to produce and evolve requirements documents across the project lifecycle for two document types: the Business Requirements Document (BRD) and the Product Requirements Document (PRD). Shared requirements-engineering knowledge lives in `references/_shared/`, while BRD-specific and PRD-specific knowledge live in `references/brd/` and `references/prd/` so each consuming agent loads only what its document needs.

The canonical BRD template is [brd-full.md](templates/brd/brd-full.md) with its [brd-frontmatter-overlay.md](templates/brd/brd-frontmatter-overlay.md), and the canonical PRD template is [prd-full.md](templates/prd/prd-full.md). The BRD Builder dispatches into the BRD phase anchors (`#discover`, `#define`, `#govern`); the PRD Builder dispatches into the PRD phase anchors (`#prd-assess` through `#prd-finalize`).

Use this skill with the references for the active document scope:

* [Requirements Definition](references/_shared/requirements-definition.md)
* [Traceability Naming](references/_shared/traceability-naming.md)
* [Traceability Matrix](references/_shared/traceability-matrix.md)

BRD scope (`references/brd/`):

* [BRD-to-PRD Handoff](references/brd/brd-to-prd-handoff-v1.md)
* [Outcome Hypothesis-to-BRD Handoff](references/brd/outcome-hypothesis-to-brd-handoff-v1.md)
* [BRD Quality Formats](references/brd/brd-quality-formats.md)

PRD scope (`references/prd/`):

## BRD Lifecycle

| Phase    | Primary objective                                                    | Entry condition                                  | Exit condition                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discover | Establish business context, stakeholder scope, and problem framing   | Request or initiative is in intake               | Discover hard gate passes and artifacts are complete           |
| Define   | Produce complete, testable, and traceable requirements content       | Discover artifacts are approved for elaboration  | Define hard gate passes with quality evidence                  |
| Govern   | Finalize, approve, and supersede BRD versions under lineage controls | Define package is approved for governance review | Govern hard gate passes and publication artifacts are recorded |

## Discover {#discover}

### Activities

* Capture business context, drivers, imposed constraints, and expected outcomes.
* Identify stakeholders, decision owners, and review participants.
* Define scope boundaries, assumptions, and dependency surfaces.
* Draft initial requirement candidates and map early traceability placeholders.
* Validate and disposition an `OUTCOME_HYPOTHESIS_TO_BRD_HANDOFF_V1` payload when one is supplied.

### Outcome hypothesis intake

Use [Outcome Hypothesis-to-BRD Handoff](references/brd/outcome-hypothesis-to-brd-handoff-v1.md)
as the canonical contract.

1. Accept the YAML inline or from a user-supplied artifact path.
2. Validate the complete payload before copying any value into the BRD.
3. Reject unsupported versions, incomplete seeds, placeholder values, and
   invalid provenance. Do not reinterpret a rejected payload as unstructured
   evidence.
4. Assign the next stable `BG-###` identifier.
5. Record distinct statement, KPI, baseline, target, timeframe, measurement
   source, and owner values.
6. Mark each seed field `accepted` or `revised`. For a revision, preserve the
   source value, current BRD value, and rationale.
7. Map assumptions and open questions into their canonical BRD sections.
   Initialize each imported question to `Open` unless Discover explicitly
   confirms another BRD-owned status. Every deferred question requires a
   rationale for deferral and one target phase: `PRD`, `Implementation`,
   `Operations`, or `Future-Release`.
8. Record the handoff ID, source path, source SHA-256, and KPI measurement
   source in the BRD provenance receipt.

Before Discover accepts the handoff, the validated payload is authoritative
for imported seed values. Discover may explicitly accept or revise those
values. After Discover exits, the BRD is authoritative. A later hypothesis
change requires a new validated payload and explicit Discover re-entry.

### Hard exit gate

Discover exits only when:

* Scope is bounded and stakeholder ownership is explicit.
* Core assumptions and constraints are documented and reviewable.
* Seed artifacts needed for Define are present and internally consistent.
* Any outcome-hypothesis handoff has passed validation, every imported seed
  field has an explicit disposition, and its provenance receipt is complete.

### Output artifacts

* Discover summary and scope statement.
* Stakeholder inventory with role and ownership mapping.
* Initial assumption and constraint register.
* Seed requirement and traceability scaffold for Define.
* Outcome-hypothesis receipt and field dispositions when a handoff was supplied.

## Define {#define}

### Activities

* Author full BRD content using [brd-full.md](templates/brd/brd-full.md) and the canonical naming rules.
* Refine business goals and requirement sets with clear acceptance intent.
* Build and verify author-maintained traceability links across FR, AC, BG, and BR records.
* Perform quality assessment using the BRD quality reporting contract.

### Hard exit gate

Define exits only when:

* Requirement content is complete, unambiguous, and testable.
* Traceability links satisfy the active ID schema and naming policy.
* FR-to-AC coverage meets the active `fr_to_ac_coverage_threshold_pct` or has a recorded blocker.
* Quality findings are generated and reviewed against the defined rubric.

### Output artifacts

* Full BRD draft package with structured sections.
* Author-maintained traceability matrix aligned to naming and ID conventions.
* BRD quality findings and consolidated quality report payloads.
* Define gate decision record with reviewer notes.

## Govern {#govern}

### Activities

* Prepare final BRD for approval with version metadata and lineage fields.
* Bump approved BRDs from draft `0.x.y` versions to `1.0.0` or higher.
* Resolve or disposition remaining quality findings.
* Publish approved BRD outputs and downstream handoff payloads.
* Maintain supersession chain when issuing replacement BRD versions.

### Govern handoff production

Before emitting `BRD_TO_PRD_HANDOFF_V1`, the BRD Builder applies the coverage and waiver validation rules in [BRD-to-PRD Handoff](references/brd/brd-to-prd-handoff-v1.md), including zero-FR coverage handling. It records the following values from the signed-off BRD and final quality review:

* A lowercase SHA-256 hash of the exact BRD artifact bytes at signoff.
* Counts for FR, NFR, BR, CON, AC, and BG identifiers using [id-schema.md](references/_shared/id-schema.md).
* FR-to-AC and FR-to-BG coverage metrics from the author-maintained traceability matrix.
* The final `BRD_QUALITY_REPORT_V1` reference, overall status, and Govern decision.
* Signoff approvers, roles, decisions, approval timestamps, comments, and active waivers.
* Waiver records for any accepted FR-to-AC threshold gap or FR-to-BG target gap.

### Hard exit gate

Govern exits only when:

* Approval status and required reviewers are recorded.
* Version and lineage metadata are valid and complete.
* The final quality report authorizes Govern exit.
* Handoff artifacts are published for downstream consumers.

### Output artifacts

* Approved BRD release artifact.
* BRD-to-PRD handoff payload.
* Governance decision log with approval evidence.
* Supersession linkage record for replaced BRD versions.

## Status taxonomy

Use the following status values for BRD lifecycle tracking:

* `draft`: Actively authored or revised.
* `in-review`: Under formal review and gate validation.
* `approved`: Accepted for governed use.
* `superseded`: Replaced by a newer approved BRD.

## Quality rubric pointer

Apply the BRD quality rubric and payload contracts from [BRD Quality Formats](references/brd/brd-quality-formats.md) together with guidance in [Requirements Definition](references/_shared/requirements-definition.md). Treat rubric results as gate evidence for Define and Govern decisions. The BRD Quality Reviewer emits both standard findings and the consolidated quality report.

## Supersession lineage rules

* A BRD can supersede one or more earlier BRDs when scope is merged.
* A BRD can be superseded by only one approved successor version.
* Every supersession event records `supersedes` and `superseded_by` links.
* Supersession preserves historical artifacts for auditability.

## PRD Lifecycle

The PRD Builder agent runs a seven-phase lifecycle. Each phase has its own section anchor below so the agent loads only the guidance for the active phase.

| Phase     | Section anchor   | Primary objective                                            |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assess    | `#prd-assess`    | Determine whether enough context exists to create PRD files. |
| Discover  | `#prd-discover`  | Establish the PRD title, scope, and product goals.           |
| Create    | `#prd-create`    | Generate the PRD file and state file once context is clear.  |
| Build     | `#prd-build`     | Gather detailed requirements iteratively.                    |
| Integrate | `#prd-integrate` | Incorporate references, documents, and external materials.   |
| Validate  | `#prd-validate`  | Ensure completeness and quality before approval.             |
| Finalize  | `#prd-finalize`  | Deliver the complete, actionable PRD.                        |

## PRD Assess {#prd-assess}

### Activities

* Determine whether enough product context exists to create PRD artifacts.
* Identify the initiative, problem statement, and primary target users.
* Check for an upstream `BRD_TO_PRD_HANDOFF_V1` payload and ingest its coverage and waiver context when present.
* Check for an upstream feasibility-to-PRD handoff. Follow [Feasibility-to-PRD Handoff](references/prd/feasibility-to-prd-handoff.md) to recognize it by `kind`, verify required metadata, verdict field presence, and a readable workspace-relative study path. Treat feasibility as supplementary evidence and preserve approved BRD scope.
* For a new session, carry the handoff kind, path, ingest timestamp, verdict, and study revision identifier in the Assess output until Create writes the state file. When state already exists, update its feasibility-specific metadata object directly. Keep raw candidate content in the handoff artifact.
* Decide whether to gather more context or proceed to file creation.

### Hard exit gate

Assess exits only when:

* A meaningful kebab-case PRD name can be derived.
* Problem framing and primary users are identified.
* Any available BRD handoff payload has been validated and its coverage metrics recorded.
* Any available feasibility handoff is recognized by `kind`, has readable workspace-relative paths, a valid verdict shape, and normalized metadata ready for Create or persisted in existing state.

### Output artifacts

* Assess summary noting context sufficiency.
* Derived working title for the PRD.
* Ingested handoff context when a BRD handoff payload exists.
* Feasibility verdict, evidence summary, constraints, gaps, and normalized handoff metadata when a feasibility handoff exists. Negative verdicts create no candidate dispositions.

## PRD Discover {#prd-discover}

### Activities

* Ask focused questions to establish the PRD title, scope, and product goals.
* Explore the problem space using [Product Discovery](references/prd/product-discovery.md) and [MVP Framing](references/prd/mvp-framing.md).
* Capture target users, candidate success metrics, and explicit non-goals using [Metrics Frameworks](references/prd/metrics-frameworks.md).

### Hard exit gate

Discover exits only when:

* Title and scope are explicit.
* Primary users and candidate success metrics are named.
* In-scope and out-of-scope boundaries are recorded.

### Output artifacts

* Discovery summary.
* Scope and non-goals statement.
* Candidate success metrics.

## PRD Create {#prd-create}

### Activities

* Generate the PRD file from [prd-full.md](templates/prd/prd-full.md) and create the session state file once title and context are clear.
* Populate the skeleton with the established scope, users, and goals.
* Seed the iterative requirement and metric structure for Build.
* When Assess produced normalized feasibility metadata, write its fields atomically to the new state file as `feasibilityHandoff`, carrying `kind`, `path`, `ingestedAt`, `verdict`, and `studyRevisionId`. State written before this contract may carry `schemaVersion` instead of `kind`; read it without error and rewrite the object to the current shape on the next feasibility metadata update. Do not persist raw candidate content.

### Hard exit gate

Create exits only when:

* The PRD file and state file exist.
* The skeleton matches the canonical PRD structure.
* Initial scope and goals are seeded.
* Any normalized feasibility metadata from Assess is present in the newly created state before Build begins.

### Output artifacts

* PRD draft skeleton.
* PRD session state file.
* Seeded scope and goals sections.
* Feasibility handoff metadata persisted when supplied.

## PRD Build {#prd-build}

### Activities

* Gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements iteratively.
* When `feasibilityHandoff` is present, read candidate content from its workspace-relative path. Stop if ingestion was reported but metadata is absent or the path is unreadable.
* Give every forward-verdict feasibility candidate exactly one PRD-owned disposition: `accepted-fr`, `accepted-nfr`, `accepted-constraint`, `retained-gap`, `rejected`, or `deferred`. Treat concern hints as advisory evidence only.
* Allocate final `FR-###`, `NFR-###`, or `CON-###` identifiers only after authoring and accepting the PRD statement. Preserve source handoff ID, source candidate ID, evidence references, disposition, rationale, and resulting PRD ID in the Feasibility Candidate Disposition register.
* Preserve signed-off BRD authority. Record and explicitly resolve BRD and feasibility conflicts, or retain them as Build gaps when current evidence cannot support a responsible resolution.
* Author acceptance criteria using [EARS Acceptance](references/prd/ears-acceptance.md) and the [Connextra Template](references/prd/connextra-template.md).
* Classify non-functional requirements with the [NIST 800-160 NFR taxonomy](references/prd/nist-800-160-nfr.md) and check stories against [INVEST](references/prd/invest.md).
* Maintain author traceability across requirements, goals, and metrics using [Traceability Naming](references/_shared/traceability-naming.md), [Traceability Matrix](references/_shared/traceability-matrix.md), and [id-schema.md](references/_shared/id-schema.md).

### Hard exit gate

Build exits only when:

* Requirements are complete, testable, and traceable.
* Acceptance criteria follow EARS or Given-When-Then form.
* Non-functional requirements are categorized.
* Coverage meets the active thresholds or records a blocker.
* Every forward-verdict feasibility candidate has exactly one disposition row, every accepted row names its final PRD ID, and negative verdicts have no candidate rows.

### Output artifacts

* Full PRD requirement set.
* Author-maintained traceability matrix.
* Acceptance criteria and NFR classifications.
* Feasibility Candidate Disposition register when a forward feasibility handoff exists.

## PRD Integrate {#prd-integrate}

### Activities

* Incorporate user-provided references, documents, and external materials.
* Reconcile incoming content with existing requirements and resolve conflicts.
* Link supporting evidence to requirements and metrics.

### Hard exit gate

Integrate exits only when:

* Provided references are incorporated or explicitly deferred.
* Conflicts between sources are resolved.
* Supporting evidence is linked.

### Output artifacts

* Updated PRD sections with integrated references.
* Reference and evidence linkage record.

## PRD Validate {#prd-validate}

### Activities

* Assess completeness and quality before approval.
* Run the PRD Quality Reviewer to emit `PRD_STANDARD_FINDINGS_V1` and `PRD_QUALITY_REPORT_V1` per [PRD Quality Formats](references/prd/prd-quality-formats.md).
* Review findings against the rubric and resolve or disposition gaps.

### Hard exit gate

Validate exits only when:

* Quality findings and the consolidated report are generated.
* The report authorizes Validate exit via `gate_decisions.validate_exit`.
* Coverage and quality thresholds are met or waived.

### Output artifacts

* PRD quality findings and report payloads.
* Validate gate decision record.

## PRD Finalize {#prd-finalize}

### Activities

* Deliver the complete, actionable PRD.
* Resolve remaining findings and record version and approval metadata.
* Run a Finalize drift check and publish downstream artifacts.

### Hard exit gate

Finalize exits only when:

* Approval status and required reviewers are recorded.
* The final quality report authorizes Finalize exit via `gate_decisions.finalize_exit`.
* No unresolved blocking findings remain.

### Output artifacts

* Approved PRD release artifact.
* Finalize decision log with approval evidence.

## References

The skill bundles reference documents under `references/`, organized into three scopes: shared requirements-engineering knowledge in `references/_shared/`, BRD-specific knowledge in `references/brd/`, and PRD-specific knowledge in `references/prd/`. Load a reference body only when its phase activity requires it; each body links to its own sub-references (standards pointers, scoring sheets, and worked examples).

## Data Contracts

Payload contracts govern quality assessment and downstream handoff for each document type. The quality and BRD handoff payloads carry a fixed `schema_version`; consumers fail fast on any other value, so those constants MUST NOT change. The feasibility-to-PRD handoff instead carries a plain `kind` marker, because its producer and consumer ship together and no version negotiation applies.

BRD data contracts:

| Contract           | `schema_version`           | Reference                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard findings  | `BRD_STANDARD_FINDINGS_V1` | [brd-standard-findings-v1.md](references/brd/brd-standard-findings-v1.md) |
| Quality report     | `BRD_QUALITY_REPORT_V1`    | [brd-quality-report-v1.md](references/brd/brd-quality-report-v1.md)       |
| BRD-to-PRD handoff | `BRD_TO_PRD_HANDOFF_V1`    | [brd-to-prd-handoff-v1.md](references/brd/brd-to-prd-handoff-v1.md)       |

PRD data contracts:

| Contract          | `schema_version`           | Reference                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard findings | `PRD_STANDARD_FINDINGS_V1` | [prd-standard-findings-v1.md](references/prd/prd-standard-findings-v1.md) |
| Quality report    | `PRD_QUALITY_REPORT_V1`    | [prd-quality-report-v1.md](references/prd/prd-quality-report-v1.md)       |

Upstream PRD input contracts:

| Contract                   | Identifier                              | Reference                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BRD-to-PRD handoff         | `schema_version: BRD_TO_PRD_HANDOFF_V1` | [brd-to-prd-handoff-v1.md](references/brd/brd-to-prd-handoff-v1.md)           |
| Feasibility-to-PRD handoff | `kind: feasibility-to-prd-handoff`      | [feasibility-to-prd-handoff.md](references/prd/feasibility-to-prd-handoff.md) |

The PRD lifecycle consumes both upstream contracts during Assess. BRD input supplies approved business context, coverage, and waivers. Feasibility input supplies a confirmed verdict, evidence, constraints, gaps, and candidate proposals for PRD Build. Neither contract bypasses PRD authoring.

## Mandatory Load Directives

The BRD Builder and PRD Builder agents each enforce a phase → section load contract. Each phase MUST load its section of this skill before executing phase work, and MUST append the section anchor to `state.phaseSkillsLoaded`.

BRD Builder directives:

| Phase    | Section anchor | Required `phaseSkillsLoaded` entry |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Discover | `#discover`    | `brd-author#discover`              |
| Define   | `#define`      | `brd-author#define`                |
| Govern   | `#govern`      | `brd-author#govern`                |

PRD Builder directives:

| Phase     | Section anchor   | Required `phaseSkillsLoaded` entry |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Assess    | `#prd-assess`    | `prd-author#assess`                |
| Discover  | `#prd-discover`  | `prd-author#discover`              |
| Create    | `#prd-create`    | `prd-author#create`                |
| Build     | `#prd-build`     | `prd-author#build`                 |
| Integrate | `#prd-integrate` | `prd-author#integrate`             |
| Validate  | `#prd-validate`  | `prd-author#validate`              |
| Finalize  | `#prd-finalize`  | `prd-author#finalize`              |

The agent loads sections via `read_file` against this skill file and records the entry in `state.phaseSkillsLoaded` before any phase work executes. Re-entering a previously loaded phase does not require reloading; the agent checks `phaseSkillsLoaded` first.

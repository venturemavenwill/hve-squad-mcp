# Design Thinking Methods Skill

Entrypoint for Design Thinking method coaching knowledge. The `dt-coach` agent loads the method reference matching the active method in coaching state, the matching deep reference when advanced technique is needed, and the industry reference when an industry context applies.

## How to use this skill

* Read the method reference for the method currently active in coaching state to ground day-to-day coaching.
* Read the matching deep reference when the conversation needs advanced facilitation, recovery techniques, or expert frameworks beyond the core method guidance.
* Read the industry reference when the team has identified one of the nine covered industries as their context, and weave its vocabulary, constraints, and empathy tools into method-specific guidance.
* Read [dt-coach-telemetry.md](references/dt-coach-telemetry.md) when DT session artifacts need observable telemetry expectations grounded in `telemetry-foundations`.

## Industry context references

Load the matching reference when the team identifies its industry context.

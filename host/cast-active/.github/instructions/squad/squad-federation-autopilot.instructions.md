# Squad Federation Autopilot Conventions

These conventions define **federation-level autopilot**: a thin meta-pipeline the Squad Federation Coordinator runs across several sub-squads under one coherent set of Human Gates. Where single-squad autopilot sequences a squad's *roles* end-to-end (`.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`), federation autopilot sequences *sub-squads*, running each sub-squad's standard single-squad autopilot unchanged as the inner engine and aggregating their gates, verdicts, and cost to the federation level.

Federation autopilot is **opt-in and additive**. It reuses every existing mechanism — each sub-squad's autopilot pipeline, council, validator loop, review, deliverable fan-out, and single-writer Scribe discipline — without changing any of them. A federation that never opts in, and any single-squad project, is completely unaffected.

## Relationship to Single-Squad Autopilot

Federation autopilot adds exactly one level above single-squad autopilot; it does not replace or alter it.

* **Single-squad autopilot** (`.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`) runs the research → plan → council → implement → review → final-outcome pipeline for one squad. It is unchanged by these conventions.
* **Federation autopilot** orders the selected sub-squads, runs each one's single-squad autopilot inner run scoped to `members/<name>/`, and aggregates every gate and verdict those inner runs raise to a single federation-level set of gates and one consolidated final-outcome validation.

Each sub-squad's inner run is byte-for-byte the single-squad autopilot pipeline: its own Research, Plan, pre-implementation council, Implement (including the bounded validator loop and any deliverable fan-out), and Review stages all run exactly as they do for a plain squad. Federation autopilot never reaches inside an inner run to change a stage; it only orders the inner runs and lifts their gates to the meta level.

## Trigger (Opt-In Surface)

Federation autopilot engages only through the `/squad-federation` prompt input `mode=autopilot`, and only when the request has **no single `squad=` target**:

* **`mode=autopilot` with no `squad=` target** → **federation autopilot**. The Federation Coordinator runs the Meta-Pipeline Contract below across the sub-squads that meta-routing selects for the request.
* **`mode=autopilot` with a single `squad=<name>` target** → **forward-only, unchanged**. The mode forwards to that one sub-squad, which runs its standard single-squad autopilot; there is no meta-pipeline. This preserves today's behavior exactly.
* **No `mode` flag** → the Federation Coordinator runs its normal per-turn protocol, forwarding any per-turn autonomy tiers to the selected sub-squad(s).

The single opt-in is the `mode=autopilot` input on `/squad-federation` without a target. When present, the Federation Coordinator records the opt-in through the Squad Scribe so the federation-root autopilot-run history file (see *Two-Level Provenance*) carries the per-run opt-in evidence.

## Precondition — the Federation Must Be Built First

Before the meta-pipeline runs, a confirmed federation must exist: `.copilot-tracking/squad/federation.md` and `meta-routing.md` are present, and every targeted sub-squad already has its built squad tree under `members/<name>/` (`team.md` and `routing.md` present). When the federation is missing, the coordinator runs **Federation Init Mode** (propose → confirm → create) from `.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md` to completion — including the user's confirmation of the sub-squad set — and only then enters the meta-pipeline. When the federation exists but a targeted sub-squad is not yet built, the coordinator escalates to run that sub-squad's Init before autopilot sequences it.

Federation autopilot never auto-seeds the federation or a sub-squad roster and never starts a meta-run without a built federation; the opt-in sequences the work, it does not waive the build.

## Meta-Pipeline Contract

Federation autopilot runs the selected sub-squads as an ordered pipeline. Each meta-stage dispatches a sub-squad's single-squad autopilot inner run scoped to `members/<name>/`, waits for its outcome and any raised gate, aggregates the result to the federation level, hands the meta-transition to the Scribe at the federation root, and advances — except where a federation-level Human Gate (below) fires.

1. **Federation plan.** Order the meta-routing-selected sub-squads by declared dependency. Derive the order from the request and the registry (for example, a `product` sub-squad's requirements before an `azure` sub-squad's build), mark independent sub-squads parallel-eligible, and confirm the proposed order with the user at the build or first gate. This meta-stage produces the ordered sub-squad execution script; it does not replace any sub-squad's own Plan stage, and it never brainstorms on a sub-squad's behalf — discovery belongs to each inner run's stage 0a.
2. **Per-sub-squad inner run.** For each sub-squad in order (or in a parallel batch when independent and the runtime supports concurrent dispatch), run its standard single-squad autopilot pipeline scoped to `members/<name>/` — its own pre-work gates (discovery at stage 0a, intake at stage 0b), Research, Plan, pre-implementation council, Implement (validator loop and deliverable fan-out included), and Review stages. Each inner run is a first-class Scribe-recorded set of stages under that sub-squad's root, exactly as for a plain autopilot run. The **discovery question is asked once at the federation level** and its answer applied to every `product` or `full` sub-squad in the run, so a fan-out does not put the same brainstorming offer three times; the *sessions* still run per sub-squad, because each one grounds its own plan, and a sub-squad on any other profile skips stage 0a silently. On an unattended federation run no offer is made at either level, per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-discovery-gate.instructions.md`.
3. **Meta-gate aggregation.** Any Impactful-Action Gate or Risk Gate raised inside *any* sub-squad's inner run surfaces as a **federation-level gate**, attributed to the sub-squad that raised it, using the same most-restrictive-wins posture as the council. The meta-pipeline pauses at the federation level; the human's approval resumes the owning sub-squad's inner run.
4. **Consolidated final-outcome validation.** After every sub-squad completes its Review stage, the federation fires a single `final-outcome` notification summarizing each sub-squad's outcome and waits for one human validation before any release-tier action anywhere. Federation autopilot never auto-releases.

The coordinator advances meta-stage to meta-stage by reading each sub-squad inner run's outcome; it hands every meta-transition to the Scribe, which records it in the federation-root autopilot-run history file and updates the federation `state.json`. The coordinator never authors sub-squad or federation state directly.

## Sub-Squad Execution Order

The Federation plan meta-stage orders sub-squads before any inner run starts:

* **Dependency-first.** When one sub-squad's output feeds another (a `product` sub-squad's requirements consumed by an `azure` sub-squad's build), the producer runs before the consumer. Dependencies are inferred from the request and the registry descriptions in `federation.md`.
* **Parallel when independent.** Sub-squads with no declared dependency between them are marked parallel-eligible and may run their inner autopilot runs concurrently when the runtime supports concurrent dispatch. Sequential execution is the default; parallel runs only when the sub-squads are explicitly independent.
* **Confirmed at the first gate.** The coordinator proposes the inferred order and confirms it with the user at the build or first gate rather than assuming it silently.

Cross-sub-squad handoff of a producer's deliverables to a downstream sub-squad flows through the producer sub-squad's recorded artifacts under `members/<producer>/`, which the downstream sub-squad's inner run consumes as research input. The mechanism is not implicit discovery: the coordinator resolves the producer's artifact paths, verifies them on disk, and hands them to the consumer as read-only inputs, per *Cross-Sub-Squad Handoff* in `.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`. A meta-stage whose producer artifact is missing stops the pipeline rather than letting the consumer re-derive it.

## Federation Human Gates

Federation Human Gates are the only points where federation autopilot stops and hands control to the human. They reuse the two gate classes from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md` unchanged, lifted to the meta level.

* A gate raised inside a sub-squad inner run **pauses the whole meta-pipeline** at the federation level, is **attributed to the sub-squad** that raised it, and fires a notification per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`. The human's approval flows back to the owning sub-squad's inner run, which resumes; the meta-pipeline then continues.
* **Impactful-Action Gate.** Any deploy, `git push` or force-push, PR merge, schema migration, data deletion, destructive infrastructure operation, secret rotation, or user-marked irreversible side effect inside any sub-squad fires the gate at the meta level. Federation autopilot completes all non-impactful work across sub-squads and stops precisely at the impactful step.
* **Risk Gate.** Any `Stop` verdict, any `Risk: High` from `security`/`cost-manager`/`rai`, any `confirm`-tier cost move, any compliance violation, validator divergence, or a cost-ceiling breach inside any sub-squad fires the gate at the meta level.
* **Most-restrictive-wins.** When two sub-squads running in parallel each raise a gate, both surface individually, each attributed to its sub-squad; the meta-pipeline resolves them with the same most-restrictive-wins posture the council uses. Simultaneous gates present as individual, attributed approvals rather than one coalesced approval.

When the approval channel is `github-issue`, a federation gate is approvable remotely from a phone exactly as a single-squad gate is: the coordinator persists the pending gate in the federation `state.json`, fires the notification, and resumes the owning sub-squad only when an authorized approval returns — never on a timeout.

## Meta-Stage Advance and Gate-Propagation Checklist (Run After Every Inner Run)

Before advancing the meta-pipeline past a sub-squad's inner run, confirm all of the following — never advance on the inner run's returned summary alone:

1. the inner run left its Review record and its per-stage `members/<name>/history/<agent>.md` entries (the inner run's own proof-of-dispatch is satisfied);
2. the federation-level `history/<sub-squad>.md` meta-transition entry was written by the Scribe;
3. **any Impactful-Action or Risk Gate raised inside the inner run was surfaced to the federation level, is attributed to the owning sub-squad, and is awaiting human approval.**

Item 3 is mandatory and safety-critical: never advance the meta-pipeline past an inner gate that was not lifted to the federation level and approved. When any item is unmet, pause the meta-pipeline, re-verify, or escalate — a lighter model must not narrate an inner run as complete, or an inner gate as cleared, without this check.

## Federation Cost Ceiling

An effective `cost-ceiling=<positive USD number>` applies across the whole federation only for `mode=autopilot` with no `squad=` target. Omission inherits it only inside the same meta-run; `cost-ceiling=unset` removes it; a new meta-run with no value is ungated. Child runs receive no ceiling in this mode, preventing double admission. Ordinary routing and targeted autopilot instead forward one independent ceiling to every selected sub-squad.

Before any inner run and every later meta round, import every selected inner-run demand row plus federation coordinator and root-writer rows. Price all rows from the federation root's `consumption-rates.md`, applying its aggregate calibration once:

```text
federation admission cost = sum(selected inner admission costs) + federation meta-orchestration admission cost
```

Persist the aggregate decision directly at the federation root before starting any child. `within-ceiling` starts its permitted set. `over-ceiling` offers stop or bounded proceed; explicit proceed appends `approved-over-ceiling` and starts one sequential sub-squad plus its root-writer handoff at a time until accumulated estimated spend reaches the ceiling. `cannot-confirm` remains blocked, including while the root calibration is ineligible. A later expansion of the selected set invalidates the approval and requires recalculation.

Each sub-squad ledger remains unchanged. Federation `currentRun.estCostUsd` is the sum of realized inner-ledger totals plus completed federation meta slots across every Cost Preflight round in the active meta-run. Count each run/round/slot tuple once from its history reference; shrinking later manifests never erase earlier completed cost. Future slots remain reserved only in `admissionCostUsd`. Reconcile the root calibration from complete aggregate runs only.

## Consolidated Final-Outcome Validation

When the meta-pipeline reaches Consolidated final-outcome validation:

1. The coordinator compiles one federation outcome: for each sub-squad, what it built, its review result, any conditions left open, and the impactful actions awaiting approval; plus the aggregate cost estimate. For any council-gated work inside a sub-squad it includes that sub-squad's Council Verdict **Decision Ref** so the human can open the exact verdict section.
2. The coordinator fires a single `final-outcome` notification to the registered approval channel through `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`. When the channel is `github-issue`, the human can validate the whole federation outcome from a phone. When no channel is configured, the notification degrades to an in-chat summary and is still logged.
3. The coordinator waits for one human validation. The human may approve (releasing the gated impactful actions across sub-squads one by one), request changes (re-entering the owning sub-squad's inner run at the appropriate stage), or stop.

## What Federation Autopilot Does Not Do

* It does not change the single-squad autopilot pipeline. Each sub-squad's inner run is unchanged.
* It does not run a meta-pipeline for a single `squad=` target. A targeted `mode=autopilot` forwards to that one sub-squad exactly as today.
* It does not auto-seed the federation or any sub-squad roster. The build precondition is never waived.
* It does not perform any impactful action without explicit human approval at a federation-level Impactful-Action Gate.
* It does not auto-release: the consolidated final outcome always returns to the human for one validation before any deploy, push, or merge in any sub-squad.
* It does not downgrade a `confirm`-tier action to `auto`. It changes *which sub-squad sequences the work*, not *which actions need a human*.

# Report Generator

Collate verified findings from all skill assessments into a single vulnerability report and write it to the reports directory.

## Purpose

* Compute summary counts for total checks, statuses, severities, and verification verdicts (audit/diff) or risk classifications (plan).
* Format findings using VULN_REPORT_V1 for audit and diff modes or PLAN_REPORT_V1 for plan mode, except when `Domain=rai`, which uses RAI_REPORT_V1 in every mode.
* Sort detailed remediation or mitigation guidance by severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
* Write the report to the reports directory using the mode-appropriate date-stamped filename pattern.
* Group findings by skill and security framework.
* For accessibility-domain reports, include the canonical accessibility disclaimer and a review artifact inventory near the report header.
* For RAI-domain reports, validate the parent-resolved RAI path, include the canonical RAI Planning caution, and preserve pending human acceptance.

## Inputs

* Verified findings collection grouped by skill name. For audit and diff modes this includes UNCHANGED pass-through items (PASS and NOT_ASSESSED findings with verdict UNCHANGED) and verified items (Deep Verification Verdict blocks from `Finding Deep Verifier` with file locations, offending code, and example fix code). For plan mode this includes plan-mode findings with statuses RISK, CAUTION, COVERED, and NOT_APPLICABLE.
* Repository name as a string.
* Report date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
* Comma-separated list of skill names assessed.
* (Optional) Mode: `audit`, `diff`, or `plan`. Determines report format and filename pattern. Defaults to `audit`.
* (Optional) Domain: `security`, `accessibility`, or `rai`. Determines report directory, filename pattern, and report format. Defaults to `security`. Supply-chain workflows should use `security` as the domain and keep the report body focused on supply-chain terminology.
* For `Domain=rai`: Mode, repository, report date, non-empty frameworks, the named RAI findings collection, resolved report path, the RAI Planning caution source and verbatim block, and `Human acceptance=PENDING` are required. Changed files are required only for diff; plan source is required only for plan.
* (Optional) Repository slug used in accessibility filenames (lowercase repository name with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by hyphens). Required when Domain is `accessibility`.
* (Optional) Changed files list with change types (added, modified, renamed) for diff mode reporting. Included as an appendix in the generated report.
* (Optional) Plan document reference path or identifier for plan mode reporting. Recorded in the report header.
* (Optional) Review artifact inventory describing the mode, scope or path focus, changed files, plan document, prior scan report, excluded non-assessable files, assessed skills, and resolved report path when known. Required when Domain is `accessibility`.
* (Optional) Accessibility disclaimer source. Defaults to `## Disclaimer Handling` in `.github/instructions/accessibility/accessibility-identity.instructions.md` when Domain is `accessibility`.

## Report Formats

Read the `security-reviewer-formats` skill for full format specifications before generating any report. Follow its normative reference links to load:

* Report Formats (`references/report-formats.md`) — VULN_REPORT_V1 template (audit and diff modes), diff mode qualifiers, and PLAN_REPORT_V1 template (plan mode).
* Finding Formats (`references/finding-formats.md`) — Verified Findings Collection Format describing the input structure.
* Completion Formats (`references/completion-formats.md`) — Scan Completion Format used by the orchestrator after report delivery.
* Use the RAI request, findings, report, response, and terminal error formats in those same references when `Domain=rai`.

## Required Steps

### Pre-requisite: Setup

1. Validate Domain before resolving or creating a report directory. Accept only `security`, `accessibility`, or `rai`; when an explicit value is unsupported, return `UNSUPPORTED_DOMAIN` with `Retryable=false` and write no report.
2. Resolve the report directory based on Domain: `.copilot-tracking/security` when Domain is `security`, `.copilot-tracking/accessibility` when Domain is `accessibility`, or `.copilot-tracking/rai-reviews` when Domain is `rai`. Create the directory if it does not exist.
3. When Domain is `rai`, validate the request against the RAI formats in `security-reviewer-formats`. Accept only the active-mode base path or that base path with `-[2-9][0-9]*` immediately before `.md`, as defined by the Report Formats collision rule. The caution must be the RAI Planning caution from `disclaimer-language.instructions.md`, and human acceptance must be `PENDING`. Return the terminal error envelope and write no report on failure. Set Retryable only from the canonical Completion Formats code-to-Retryable mapping.
4. Do not include secrets, credentials, or sensitive environment values in the report.
5. When Domain is `accessibility`, read the accessibility disclaimer source and extract the canonical CAUTION block verbatim before assembling the report. Do not substitute the shared planning disclaimer.
6. When Domain is `accessibility`, normalize the review artifact inventory into table rows. Use `N/A` for optional inputs that were not supplied and `None` for empty changed-files or excluded-files lists.

### Step 1: Determine Sequence Number

Applies to security domain only. Accessibility-domain filenames embed the repository slug and date, so no sequence number is computed; skip this step and use the resolved date directly when Domain is `accessibility`.

1. Select the filename prefix based on mode:
   * When mode is `audit`: search for `security-report-*.md`.
   * When mode is `diff`: search for `security-report-diff-*.md`.
   * When mode is `plan`: search for `plan-risk-assessment-*.md`.
2. Search `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}` for existing files matching the selected pattern where `{REPORT_DATE}` is the provided report date.
3. Extract the numeric sequence suffix from each matching filename.
4. Set the sequence number to one greater than the highest existing sequence number. If no matching files exist, set the sequence number to `001`.
5. Zero-pad the sequence number to three digits.

### Step 2: Compute Summary Counts

* When mode is `audit` or `diff`:
  1. Iterate over all verified findings and count each status: PASS, FAIL, PARTIAL, NOT_ASSESSED.
  2. Compute a total count across all statuses.
  3. For FAIL and PARTIAL findings only, count findings at each severity level: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
  4. Count verification verdicts: CONFIRMED, DISPROVED, DOWNGRADED, UNCHANGED.
  5. Use verified statuses and severities (not original pre-verification values) for all counts.
* When mode is `plan`:
  1. Iterate over all plan-mode findings and count each status: RISK, CAUTION, COVERED, NOT_APPLICABLE.
  2. Compute a total count across all statuses.
  3. For RISK and CAUTION findings only, count findings at each severity level: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
  4. No verification verdicts apply in plan mode.

### Step 3: Build Report Sections

* When mode is `audit`:
  1. Write the executive summary as a 3–5 sentence narrative covering the most critical findings, skills assessed, total checks, and verification outcomes.
  2. When Domain is `accessibility`, add the canonical accessibility disclaimer immediately after the title and header metadata, then add a `## Review Artifacts` section with a markdown table containing Artifact, Value, and Required columns before the findings sections.
  3. Build the Findings by Framework section with one H3 subsection per assessed skill. Each subsection contains a markdown table with rows ordered by severity: CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, PASS, NOT_ASSESSED. Include a Location column with markdown links in the form `[path/to/file.ext#L42](path/to/file.ext#L42)`. Include Verdict and Justification columns with the verification verdict for each finding.
  4. Build the Detailed Remediation Guidance section grouped by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). For each FAIL or PARTIAL finding, include:
     * A markdown file link to the vulnerable location.
     * An "Offending Code" fenced code block with the vulnerable snippet.
     * An "Example Fix" fenced code block with corrected code.
     * Numbered remediation steps.
     * The verification verdict and justification.
  5. Group all affected file locations under a single remediation subsection when the same vulnerability appears in multiple files, listing each location with its own Offending Code and Example Fix blocks.
  6. Build the Remediation Checklist with one row per CONFIRMED or DOWNGRADED item, each with NOT_STARTED status. Exclude DISPROVED findings from the checklist.
  7. Note disproved findings in a separate "Disproved Findings" subsection within the Detailed Remediation Guidance section for transparency.
  8. Build the Appendix: Skills Used table with one row per assessed skill.
  9. Use "None identified." as the section content when a section has no findings.
* When mode is `diff`:
  1. Follow the same steps as audit mode with these modifications.
  2. Use the diff mode title: `# Security Assessment Report — Changed Files Only`.
  3. Add the `**Scope:** Changed files relative to {default_branch}` header field.
  4. Build all standard VULN_REPORT_V1 sections as in audit mode.
  5. When Domain is `accessibility`, include changed files in the `## Review Artifacts` table; also append the existing "Changed Files" appendix after the Skills Used appendix for compatibility with prior report structure.
  6. Append a "Changed Files" appendix section after the Skills Used appendix, listing each changed file with its change type (added, modified, renamed).
  7. Use "None identified." as the section content when a section has no findings.
* When mode is `plan`:
  1. Write the executive summary as a 3–5 sentence narrative summarizing theoretical risks identified in the plan, skills assessed, total checks, and severity distribution.
  2. When Domain is `accessibility`, add the canonical accessibility disclaimer immediately after the title and header metadata, then add a `## Review Artifacts` section with a markdown table containing Artifact, Value, and Required columns before the risk findings sections.
  3. Build the Risk Findings by Framework section with one H3 subsection per assessed skill. Each subsection contains a markdown table with columns: ID, Title, Status, Severity, Risk Description, Mitigation. Rows are ordered by severity: CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, COVERED, NOT_APPLICABLE. COVERED and NOT_APPLICABLE rows use `N/A` for Risk Description and Mitigation.
  4. Build the Mitigation Guidance section grouped by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). For each RISK or CAUTION finding, include: risk description, attack scenario, numbered mitigation steps, and an implementation checklist.
  5. Build the Implementation Security Checklist with one row per RISK or CAUTION item, each with NOT_STARTED status.
  6. Build the Appendix: Skills Used table with one row per assessed skill.
  7. Use "None identified." as the section content when a section has no findings.

### Step 4: Write Report File

1. Select the report format and filename pattern based on mode and Domain:
   * When Domain is `security` and mode is `audit`: assemble the report following VULN_REPORT_V1 and write to `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}/security-report-{NNN}.md`.
   * When Domain is `security` and mode is `diff`: assemble the report following VULN_REPORT_V1 with diff mode qualifiers and write to `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}/security-report-diff-{NNN}.md`.
   * When Domain is `security` and mode is `plan`: assemble the report following PLAN_REPORT_V1 and write to `.copilot-tracking/security/{REPORT_DATE}/plan-risk-assessment-{NNN}.md`.
   * When Domain is `accessibility` and mode is `audit`: assemble the report following VULN_REPORT_V1 with accessibility terminology (success criteria, conformance levels, assistive-technology impacts) and write to `.copilot-tracking/accessibility/{REPORT_DATE}/accessibility-report-{REPO}-{YYYYMMDD}.md`.
   * When Domain is `accessibility` and mode is `diff`: assemble the report following VULN_REPORT_V1 with accessibility terminology and diff mode qualifiers and write to `.copilot-tracking/accessibility/{REPORT_DATE}/accessibility-report-diff-{REPO}-{YYYYMMDD}.md`.
   * When Domain is `accessibility` and mode is `plan`: assemble the report following PLAN_REPORT_V1 with accessibility terminology and write to `.copilot-tracking/accessibility/{REPORT_DATE}/accessibility-plan-assessment-{REPO}-{YYYYMMDD}.md`.
    * When Domain is `rai`: assemble RAI_REPORT_V1 and write only to the validated parent-resolved RAI path for the active mode. Never overwrite an occupied path; return `REPORT_WRITE_FAILED` using the canonical Completion Formats mapping.
2. Write the assembled report to the resolved path where `{REPORT_DATE}` is the resolved date, `{NNN}` is the resolved sequence number (security domain only), `{REPO}` is the repository slug (accessibility and RAI domains), and `{YYYYMMDD}` is the report date with hyphens removed (accessibility and RAI domains).
3. When Domain is `accessibility`, add the resolved report path to the `## Review Artifacts` table before writing the file.
4. Print a one-line confirmation: "Report saved → {resolved_report_path}".

## Response Format

Return structured findings including:

* Path to the written report file.
* Report format used: VULN_REPORT_V1 (audit or diff) or PLAN_REPORT_V1 (plan).
* Scanning mode that determined the report format.
* Generation status: complete or incomplete.
* Severity breakdown: critical, high, medium, and low counts for actionable findings.
* Summary counts: pass, fail, partial, and not-assessed for audit and diff modes; risk, caution, covered, and not-applicable for plan mode.
* Verification counts: confirmed, disproved, and downgraded totals. Included for audit and diff modes only.
* Clarifying questions when inputs are ambiguous or missing.
* When Domain is `rai`, return the RAI generator response from `security-reviewer-formats` Completion Formats. Fail closed with its terminal error envelope for unsupported domains, invalid modes or payloads, path mismatch, missing caution, human-acceptance violation, malformed verdicts, and report-write failures. Set Retryable only from the canonical Completion Formats code-to-Retryable mapping.

# Code Review Accessibility

Thin perspective subagent for the Code Review orchestrator. It evaluates a precomputed diff for accessibility conformance traceable to a loaded `accessibility` skill and success criterion, and writes structured findings. All review logic comes from the `code-review` skill; this file only binds the accessibility preset and the skill catalog.

This perspective is self-contained: it sources its review logic from the `code-review` and `accessibility` skills and does not call the standalone Accessibility Reviewer agent. When a high-risk UI surface is in scope, it may add a one-line note that a deeper standalone accessibility audit exists.

## Skill Reference Contract

At the start of the run, locate the skill named `code-review` and read these files from it once in a single parallel `read_file` block (paths are relative to that skill), then apply them verbatim:

* `SKILL.md` (skill entrypoint)
* `references/lens-checklists.md` (Accessibility review section)
* `references/depth-tiers.md`
* `references/severity-taxonomy.md`
* `references/output-formats.md`

Do not invent severity levels, categories, or output fields the skill does not define.

## Accessibility Skill Catalog

Findings must trace to one of these skills and a specific success criterion or authoring pattern. Load only the skills relevant to the diff by locating each accessibility skill by its name from the catalog below and reading its `SKILL.md`, then follow its references only to substantiate a finding:

| Skill         | Covers                                                                    | Typical surfaces                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `wcag-22`     | WCAG 2.2 success criteria (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) | Web and any HTML-rendered UI                 |
| `aria-apg`    | ARIA Authoring Practices — roles, states, properties, keyboard patterns   | Custom widgets, composite components         |
| `coga`        | Cognitive accessibility — clear language, predictable behavior            | Content, forms, flows                        |
| `section-508` | U.S. Section 508 (Revised) chapters and functional performance criteria   | U.S. federal procurement scope               |
| `en-301-549`  | EN 301 549 clauses (web, non-web documents, software, hardware)           | EU procurement, non-web documents, native UI |

## Lane Preset

* **Perspective**: Accessibility review (apply the Accessibility review checklist from lens-checklists.md).
* **Categories**: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust, Cognitive.
* **Lane boundary**: Stay within accessibility conformance traceable to a loaded skill and criterion. Do not flag logic errors, general coding-standard violations, or cosmetic preferences without a success-criterion basis.

## Required Steps

1. **Read input and self-scope.** Read `diff-state.json` once for `task`, `reviewTarget`, `reviewProfile`, `branch`, `base`, `files`, `untrackedFiles`, `extensions`, `diffPatchPath`, `findingsFolder`, `depthTier`, `hotspots`, and `outOfScope`. Require `task.kind` to equal `perspective_batch` and resolve the output path from `task.outputs.accessibility`. Determine from `files` and `extensions` whether any user-facing UI, markup, or document surface is in scope. If none is present, write an empty findings report to that path (Output contract with empty arrays) noting "No accessibility-relevant surface in diff" and return.
2. **Read references and diff.** In one parallel block, read the Skill Reference Contract files, the in-scope `accessibility/<skill>/SKILL.md` files, and the diff at `diffPatchPath` once (full file). When `untrackedFiles` is non-empty, read those files in full and treat every line as in-scope. Do not re-read the diff for any reason.
3. **Apply perspective at depth.** Analyze every changed UI hunk through the five categories against the applicable success criteria and patterns, applying the `depthTier` rigor dial from depth-tiers.md. Give deeper scrutiny to `hotspots`; skip `outOfScope`. Use search and usages tools to confirm consuming markup, existing ARIA, and component-library affordances before recording a barrier.
4. **Grade and record findings.** Assign severity per severity-taxonomy.md. For each finding capture file, line range, category, the originating skill, the success criterion or pattern, problem, the exact `current_code`, and a concrete `suggested_fix`. Omit findings whose worst case is subjective preference.
5. **Write structured findings.** Write to `task.outputs.accessibility` using the Output contract schema from output-formats.md, setting each finding's `skill` to the originating accessibility skill. Do not write a markdown report. Return a one-line summary of severity counts, the skills evaluated, and the exact findings file path.

If clarification is genuinely required before review can proceed, return the questions instead of findings rather than guessing.
